Zürich Theology in a Puritan  Gentleman's  Library 

by  D A V ID  J.  K B EP 

Lanhydrock  House,  near  Bodmin  in  Cornwall,  now  belongs  to  the 
National  Trust  for  Places  of  Historie  Interest  or  Natural  Beauty.  It  was 
built  1635-1642  by  the  son  of  a  Truro  merchant,  who  had  purehased  a 
peerage  from  Charles  I.  Richard  Robartes  employed  Hannibal  Gamon, 
rector  of  Mawgan-in-Pyder,  to  act  as  chaplain  and  to  collect  a  library. 
John  Robartes  housed  this  collection  of  puritan  and  Protestant  works  in 
his  new  mansion.  It  has  amazingly  survived  royalist  occupation  during 
the  Civil  War,  the  reconciliation  of  the  family  with  the  Church  of  Eng(cid:173)
land  under  Charles  I I,  and  a  disastrous  fire  which  destroyed  all  but  the 
north  wing in  1881. The  books were thrown  from  the  Windows, which  may 
account  for  the  careful  rebinding  of  some  of  them.  The  estate  was  given 
to  the  Trust  in  1953, but  one  of the  family  continued  to  live in  the  house 
until  1969.  Her  bedroom  reflects  an  anglican  piety  in  marked  contrast 
to  the  militant  puritanism  of  the  Cromwellian  Field-marshal.  The  house 
was rebuilt  after  the  fire.  The  books  are now  housed  in  the  splendid  north 
gallery,  where  I  was  able  to  examine  them  by  courtesy  of  Mr.  Donald 
Prentice,  the  administrator  of  the  estate.  A  copy  of  the  catalogue  is 
available  at  42  Queen  Anne's  Gate,  London. 

The  Library  contains  nothing  by  Zwingli.  It  has  five  works  by  Bullin-
ger,  three  by  Peter  Martyr  Vermigli  and  an  astonishing  nineteen  by 
Rudolph  Gwalther1.  Bullinger's  Centuria  Memoralium 
is 
epistolas2. 
part  of  Gwalther's  Archetypi  homeliarum 
The  oldest  work,  Besurrectio,  Zürich  1545,  is  the  only  copy  recorded  in 
Great  Britain3.  There  is  a  Latin  text  of  Refutatio  Bullae  papisticaei, 
the 
English  translation  of  De  fine  seculi5  and  Ad  Testamentum  D. 
Ioannis 
Brentii6.  The  works  by  Martyr  are  In  Epistolam  ad  Romanos,  Zürich 
1559,  an  English  translation  without  its  title  page,  recorded  as  1568,  and 
In  Regum  Libri  Duo,  Heidelberg  1599.  These  alone  are  valuable  sources 
for  church  historians  in  the  west  of  England.

The  Gwalther  collection  is outstanding.  One  is the  only  known  copy  of 
the  edition  so  far,  one  is recorded  only  in Zurieh,  and  one  known  only  in 
three  libraries.  The  British  Museum  has  only  three  of  the  Lanhydrock 
editions,  and  the  Cambridge  Colleges  together  only  five  of  the  sixteenth-
century  ones7.  The  unique  volume  is  the  eighth  edition  of  De 
syllabarum 
Ioannis  Loei 
et  carminum 
ratione  libri  duo,  Antverpiae  Apud  Viduam 
Anno  1568.  Like the  volume  known  only  in Zürich,  Archetypi 
homiliarum 
festarum,  Zürich  1612,  this  is  an  octavo,  and  hence  more  easily  lost.  The 
is in  its 
Antwerp  volume  is rebound  in  half  red  leather,  but  the  Archetypi 
original  vellum.  The  other  scarce  edition  is  the  fifth  and  final  of 
In 
epistolam  ad  Romanos,  Heidelberg  1614.  There  is  only  one  work  in 
English,  A  hundred,  threescore  and  fiftene  Homelyes  or  Sermons  uppon 
the 
actes  of  the  Apostles,  London  15728.  There  is  also  the  curious  bi-lingual 
IOYAIOY  nOAYAEYKOY  ONOMAZTIKON  EN  BIBAIOIZ  AEKA,  Frank(cid:173)
furt  1608.  All  the  other  volumes  are  Latin  commentaries  on  the  Bible9. 
Six  of  them  have  the  same  autograph  in  1616,  possible  a  bookseller's. 
Two  are  duplicates.  I  suspect  Robartes  purchased  more  than  he  read. 
Was  this  a  random  collection,  or  the  basis  for  a  library  for  local  clergy ? 
I  hope  it  was  not  an  investment  as  seventeenth  Century  theology  is  still 
more  rare  than  expensive!  Modern  scholars  can  be  very  grateful  for  three 
centuries  of  quiet  country  living  which  have  preserved  the  collection. 
There  are  several  hundred  works  by  other  writers  which  will  find  a  place 
in  bibliographical  and  theological  studies.
