Introduction  * 

in  Scotland1, 

Eighty  nine  years  ago  Hume  Brown  published  his  well-known  book 
in  which  he  brought  together  all  known 
Early  Travellers 
accounts  of  Scotland  written  by  travellers  who  had  visited  the  country 
before  1700.  This  eollection  was  confined  to  printed  sources  and  within 
these  limits  Hume  Brown  spared  no  effort  to  make  his  work  exhaustive. 
Four  years  later  this  source  material  was  augmented  by  the  publication 
of  the  Journal  of  Lupoid  von  Wedel  (1544-1615),  a  young  Pomeranian 
nobleman  who  spent  much  of  his  life  as  a  restless  wanderer  and  who  vis(cid:173)
ited  England  and  Scotland  in  1584-15852.  Since  the  appearance  of  this 
diary,  which  contains  a  detailed  description  of  Wedel's  tour  of  Scotland, 
nothing  of  a  similar  nature  for  this  period  by  a  German  traveller  has  un-
til  recently  come  to  light3.  Consequently  in  his  authoritative  monograph,

(London  1953),  W . D.  Robson-
German  Travellers  in  England  1400-1800 
Scott  has  singled  it  out  as  "one  of  the  very  few  German  Travel  diaries 
down  to  the  end  of  the  eighteenth  Century  which  include  Scotland  in 
their  itinerary4".  Further,  Wedel's  visit  to  Britain,  which  included  nine-
teen  days  in  Scotland  and  took  him  as  far  north  as  Perth,  and  which 
lasted  fifty  three  weeks  in  all,  has  been  held  to  exceed  "in  both  length 
and  scope  t h at  of  any  other  German  traveller  of  the  period5".  A  recent 
discovery,  however,  has  revealed  a  hitherto  unknown  diary,  or  more  cor-
rectly  itinerary  of  a  tour  of  England,  Scotland  and  Ireland  in  1591-1592 
made  by  J an  Peter  Hainzel  von  Degerstein  and  written  by  his  tutor  and 
companion  Caspar  Waser6.  This  itinerary,  preserved  in  the  Zentral(cid:173)
bibliothek,  Zürich,  records  a  stay  in  Scotland  much  more  extensive  and 
of  considerably  longer  duration  than  that  of  Wedel,  or  indeed  of  any 
known  traveller  of  the  period,  until the  tour  undertaken  by J a k ob  Fetzer 
(t  1634)  of  Nürenberg  in  1618-16206". 

Unlike  Wedel,  Hainzel  von  Degerstein  belongs  to  a  distinctive  class  or 
type  of  sixteenth  and  early  seventeenth  Century  traveller,  the  young 
man  of noble  birth  who had  been  sent  on  travel  by  his  parents  or  guard-
ian  to  acquire  a  knowledge  of the  world.  In  the  second  half  of the  Century 
a  large  number  of  these  aristocratic  travellers,  who  were  making  the 
Grant  Tour,  began  to  visit  England  and  sometimes  Scotland. 

Amongst  those  to  include  Scotland  were  Louis  de  Chastaigner,  the 

young  lord  of  La  Roche  Posay,  who,  with  his  celebrated  tutor,  J. J.  Sca(cid:173)
liger  (1540-1609),  visited  this  country  in  15667,  Henri,  Duc  de  Rohan 
(1579-1638),  the  later  Huguenot  leader,  who  arrived  in  16008,  and  Ja-
roslav  Smiricky  from  Moravia  who,  along  with  his  tutor,  Caspar  Dorna-
vius  (1577-1623),  a  learned  physician,  arrived  in  16079.  Neither  Scaliger

nor  Dornavius  has left  behind  a  diary  of their  nobleman's  visit,  b ut  that 
by  Rohan  is  well-known  and  was  printed  by  Hume  Brown.  No  German 
belonging  to  this  type  of  traveller,  however,  appears  to  have  visited 
Scotland  before  Hainzel.  Indeed  Hainzel's  visit  to  the  British  Isles  pre-
ceded  by several  months  t h at  of the most  notorious  of all German  travel-
lers  to  England,  Frederick,  Count  of  Würtemburg;  the  diary  of  whose 
visit  in the summer  of  1592, written  by his secretary Jakob  Rathgeb,  has 
hitherto  been  regarded  as t he  earliest  Journal  of  the  visit  to  England  of 
any  German  traveller  of  this  class10. 

Johann  Peter  Hainzel  von Degerstein  (1572-1608)  belonged  to  an  old 
Augsburg  family11.  In  1586, his  brother  Johannes  Heinrich,  one  of  the 
magistrates  of the  city,  quarrelled  with  his fellow  "Senators"  and  taking 
J an  Peter  with  him  left  for  Zürich1 2.  Anxious  that  his  brother  should 
receive  the  broad  education  of a  young  man  of his social  class  and  of his 
age,  Johannes  Heinrich  sought  in Zürich  a  tutor  who should  accompany 
him  to the universities  and on a  Grand  Tour.  On the advice  of J. G.  Stuk-
kius  and other  leading  ministers,  he secured  the Services  of Caspar  Waser 
(1565-1625),  a  young  man  of  twenty  one  years  who  was  engaged  in 
theological  study  at  the  University  of  Heidelberg1 3. 
Caspar  Waser's  family  had  a  notable  record  of  Service  to  Zürich  to  its 
credit  and  had  played  a  prominent  part  in  the  life  of  t h at  city.  Johann 
Waser,  Caspar's  father,  had  been  a  physician  and  a  friend  of  the  cele-
brated  Conrad  Gesner  (1516-1565). His grandfather  had been  Town  Clerk 
in  the  early  days  of  the  Reformation  and  had  been  killed  at  the  Battle 
of  Cappel  in  1531, the  battle  which  witnessed  the  death  of the  Reformer 
Ulrich  Zwingli.  Waser  received  his  early  education  in  Zürich  until  1584 
and  in  t h at  year  went  to  study  at  Altdorf  where  he  matriculated  on  9th 

For  Dornavius see Allgemeine Deutsche  Biographie, 5.351f. Jaroslav  Smiricky was 
not  the first  Moravian  of this  period  to  visit  Scotland.  Jan  Bernard  of Prerov,  a 
student  at Oxford and friend  of Robert  Dudley, Earl of Leicester, visited  Scotland 
in  1584-85, and others followed  to the end of the first decade of the next  Century.

July1 4.  At  the  end  of  the  following  winter  he  was  sent  to  Heidelberg15 
where  some  of the  best  Calvinist  theologians  of the  day  were  reviving  the 
reputation  of  that  University  as  the  metropolis  of  Reformed  theologieal 
learning. 

Soon  after  Waser's  recall  to  Zürich  in  1586,  the  young  nobleman  and 

his  tutor  set  out  for  Geneva  and  its  already  illustrious  Academy1 6.  Wa(cid:173)
ser's  name  is  found  in  Le  Livre  du  Becteur,  bot  not  that  of  Hainzel1 7.  At 
Geneva,  Waser  continued  his  theologieal  studies  for  eighteen  months 
under  Theodore  Beza,  Antoine  de  la  Faye  and  Pierre  Chevallier,  but  on 
the  out break  of  plague  the  two  young  men  withdrew  from  the  city18 
and  subsequently  moved  to  the  University  of  Basel  where  they  both 
matriculated  and  remained  from  November  1587  to  the  end  of  April 
15911». 

These  years  in  Basel  partly  coincided  with  the  time  spent  there  by  the 
young  Scottish  Student,  Robert  Howie  (c.l565-c.l645)2 0,  later  the  first 
Principal  of  Marischal  College,  Aberdeen,  and  successor  of  the  renowned 
Andrew  Melville  in  St.  Mary's  College,  St.  Andrews.  Some  time  during 
the  summer  of  1590,  Waser  and  Hainzel  also  made  the  acquaintanoe  of 
J o hn  Johnston  (c. 1565-1611)21  who  had  been  a  Student  at  Heidelberg 
and  became  on  his  return  to  Scotland  one  of  Melville's  colleagues  in 
St.  Andrews.  These  Scottish  friendships,  as  later  events  prove,  meant 
much  to  Hainzel  and  Waser. 

On  Ist  May,  Johannes  Heinrich  recalled  his  brother  and  tutor  from 
Basel  to  "Elkovia"  (Elckau)  where  he  had  become  the  overlord  of  an 
estate2 2,  and  shortly  thereafter  they  set  out  on  the  northern  part  of  a

Grand Tour, a journey that was to take them through Germany, the Low 
Countries,  England,  Scotland  and  Ireland23. 

The Itinerary,  which has now come to light,  Covers only the  Northern 
part  of  the  tour  and  is  extant  in  two  forms,  one  in  Latin,  the  other  in 
German.  The  Latin  version  has been  carefully  drawn  up by  Waser,  pos-
sibly with the intention  of having it  printed.  It  records the  stages  of  the 
journey  in  considerable  detail  and  gives the  distances  between  them  ac-
cording  to  the  System  of  measurement  used  by  the  several  countries 
through  which they  passed24.  The day  of the  week is marked  by  the  ap-
propriate  planetary  symbol25  placed  after  the  date  and  in  addition  the 
places where they  stopped for meals are indicated26.  Unfortunately  com-
ment  is  throughout  so  meagre  that  the  document  cannot  be  compared 
with  those  already  known,  especially  with  Wedel's  in  which  there  are 
long  descriptions  of  the  people  met  and  the  places  visited.  Waser's  Ho-
doeporica is  merely  a  record  of  the  journey,  an  itinerary  in  the  strict 
meaning of the word. The German  version is similar, but  has not  been so 
carefully  drawn  up. It  omits the  distances  between  the  various  stages of 
the  journey  and  there  are  some minor  discrepancies  in  the  dates  of  the 
two versions. On the other hand, it is, especially in its record of the  Scot-
tish  part  of  the  tour,  much  more  informative.  A  number  of  brief  notes 
have  been  inserted,  which  add  considerable  interest  to  the  account. 
Neither  version  can  be  regarded  as  the  original  made  during  the  tour. 
Both have been drawn up later with the aid of notes taken on the journey. 
Further,  it is impossible to arrive at  an exact  date of composition  during 
Waser's  life-time27. 

The extracts which follow cover the itinerary through the British Isles, 

but  in  order  that  this  part  of  the  travels  may  be  viewed  in  proper  per(cid:173)
spective  an  account  of the  whole tour  must  first  be briefly  sketched. 

The tour  began  on  24th  May.  Travelling  by  way  of  Schaffhausen  and 
Offenburg  they  arrived  on the  28th at  Strasbourg,  where they  spent  the 
weekend.  The  following  Monday  they  set  out  for  Hamburg  which  was 
reached  after  sixteen  days  of  continuous  travel  by  way  of  Heidelberg, 
Frankfurt,  Giessen,  Cassel,  Münden  and  Brunswick.  On  average  four

German  miles  were  traversed  every  day  and  the  total  distance  from 
Elckau  reckoned  at  seventy-five  German  miles28. 

The  day  following  their  arrival  in  Hamburg  they  embarked  on  a  ship 
"tormentis  et reliquo  apparatu  bellico instructam"  for  Amsterdam.  After 
two  days  in  the  open  sea  they  entered  the Zuider  Zee;  on  20th  J u ne  they 
disembarked  at  Amsterdam2 9. 

A  week  was  spent  in  visiting  a  number  of  important  cities,  including 
Alcmar  and  Utrecht3 0;  on  28th  they  reached  Leiden3 1;  and  on  8th  July 
both  Hainzel  and  Waser  matriculated  as  students  at  the  University3 2. 
There they remained until  lOth December,  apart  from  Ist to  19th  October, 
during  which  they  continued  to  explore  the  Low  Countries33. In  all,  some 
twenty  three  weeks were spent  in study  and  travel  which Waser  reckoned 
to  have  covered  one  hundred  and  seventy  two  "Belgian  miles3 4". 

On  lOth  December  they  set  out  from  Leiden  on  t h at  part  of  their  tour 
which  was  to  include  the  British  Isles3 5.  Travelling  by  way  of the  Hague, 
taking  in  Delft  and  Rotterdam,  Dortrecht  and  Middelburg,  they  reached 
Flushing  on  the  17th36,  met  the  Protestant  Pastor,  Daniel  de  Dieu3 7, 
and  the  English  Governor,  Sir  Robert  Sidney3 8.  That  night  they  em(cid:173)
barked  for  England. 

The  crossing  was  uneventful  and  comparatively  short,  but  most  of  the 
18th  had  to  be  spent  in  the  Thames  estuary  waiting for  a  favourable  tide 
to  take  them  up  the  river  to  Gravesend.  About  1.00  p . m.  on  Sunday 
they  arrived  in  London,  having  visited  the  royal  palace  at  Greenwich 
en  route3 9. 

Ten  weeks  were  then  spent  in  visiting  per  licentiam  superiorum40 

the 
usual  sights,  but  only  the  Queen  and  Westminster  Hall  were  considered 
worthy  of  record41.  Kvosen,  in  his  memorial  address  informs  us  t h at

Waser  saw the  Queen  "opportuno  loco e sacello egredientem42".  At  this 
time  Waser  met  in  London  his  friend  John  Johnston  who,  along  with 
Howie, had returned  from  the  Continent  in the  Spring or early  Summer, 
and  who  had  been  detained  by  illness  in  London43.  Howie  had  already 
preceded  him  to  Aberdeen. 

A visit to Scotland had, it appears, been planned by the German travel-
lers from  the beginning, and indeed was intended to form  an integral part 
of  their  British  itinerary.  On  2nd  Mareh,  therefore,  they  set  out,  in  all 
probability  by  post-horses,  on  their  northern  journey44.  Following  the 
usual route through Ware, Huntingdon and Newark they arrived at  York 
on  Monday  7th  March. At  York  the  travellers  turned  off  the  main  road 
to  visit  the  Lake  District  and  taking the  road  across Stanemoor  to  Pen-
rith  arrived  at  Keswick  on  lOth March. A brief note in the  German  Ver(cid:173)
sion  explains  this  diversion45.  It  was  to  visit  the  family  of  Hochstetter 
who had been  brought  over by  Queen  Elizabeth  to work the rieh  copper 
mines  in  the  surrounding  district.  The  Hochstetters  had  come  from 
Augsburg and had most probably been known to Hamzel's family.  It  was 
therefore  to  be  expected  that  the  young  nobleman  should  wish  to  visit 
his  fellow  burghers.  The  natural  beauty  of  the  Lake  District  was  not, 
however,  ignored;  before  they  left,  towards  the  end  of  April,  they  had 
toured  the  countryside  as far  as Cockermouth  to the west  and  Carlisle to 
the  north46. 

On  24th  April  the  journey  was  continued  across  country  to  Hexham 
and  Newcastle  where  they  spent  a  week.  On  3rd  May  they  crossed  the 
Tweed and entered Berwick. At this point  the Latin  Version records  that 
this  was  the  first  city  of  Scotland—that  is,  the  first  to  be  entered  by 
those  travelling  from  England—and  that  it  was  presently  occupied  by 
the  English47.  The  note  is  of  interest  in  that  it  shows  that  Waser  had 
either been so informed  subsequently  in Scotland or that  he was depend-
ent  on  Boece and  not  Camden,  the  usual  authority  for  travellers48.

44  Foreign  travellers  commonly  rode  post-horses,  changing  mounts  at  well-kown 
stages, and  covering between twenty and  thirty  miles a day, acoording to the  weather 
and  the  State  of the  roads.  (See further  S.  and  B.  Webb,  English  Local  Government:

From  the  German  version  we learn  that  the  visitors  carried  letters  of 
recommendation  to  the  English  Deputy  Governor,  who  provided  them, 
as had beendone  for Wedel eightyears  earlier49, with  an escort  of  soldiers 
to  take  them  into  Scotland50.  At  this  point  and until  the travellers  leave

Hainzel and Waser  left  Berwick  on 4th May for  Edinburgh,  and  taking 
the  coastal route passing Fastcastle  and through  Dunbar  and  Haddington 
they  came  to  Seton.  At  Seton  they  viewed  the  palace  of  Robert  Seton, 
6th  Lord  Seton  and  Ist  Earl  of  Winton,  whom  Waser  described  as  "a 
learned  nobleman  and  an  admirer  of  foreign  nations5 1".  Two  days  were 
spent  in  Edinburgh,  no  doubt  in  visiting  the  sights,  and  on  the  third,  a 
Sunday,  they  went  out  to  Dalkeith  Palace  to  seek  an  audience  of  t he 
King. Wedel had been  permitted  to view the King  only from  a  distance5 2, 
but  Hainzel  was  more  highly  honoured.  He  carried  with  him  a  letter  of 
introduction  to  King  James.  It  was from  Waser's  former  teacher  at  Ge(cid:173)
neva—one  from  whom  King  James  would  at  any  time  have  been  de-
lighted  to  receive  a  letter—the  leading  Calvinist  theologian  of  the  day, 
Theodore  Beza.  Unfortunately  Waser  gives  no  description  of  the  King 
and  teils  us nothing  of what  took  place,  except  t h at  they  were  graciously 
received,  t h at  they  were  granted  permission  to  travel  anywhere  in  the 
Kingdom,  and  t h at  the  King  made  an  entry  in  the  young  nobleman's 
Stammbuch  or  Album 

amicorum53. 

For  the  following  four  days  the  travellers  remained  in  Edinburgh  and 
there  made  the  acquaintance  of a  number  of people, b ut  in the  Itinerary 
Waser  mentions  only  one, Thomas  Seggate  (or Seget),  an  early  graduate 
of  Edinburgh  University,  who was well-known  to  Justus  Lipsius  at Lou-
vain  and  a  number  of  important  literary  families  in  Italy5 4.  Another 
acquaintance  was  Adrian  Damman  of  Ghent,  "a  gentleman  of  singular 
learning"  who had, previous  to his arrival  in Edinburgh  about  1589, been 
a  professor  at  Leiden.  He  had  become  a  particular  literary  favourite  of 
King  James  VI  and  held  the  post  of  Professor  of  Humanity  at  the  Uni(cid:173)
versity  of  Edinburgh  from  about  1590 to  159355.  At  the  time  of  Waser's

visit  Damman  was  engaged  in  translating  into  Latin  the  long  religious 
poem  on  the  creation  of  the  world  by  the  Huguenot  poet  Du  Bartas. 
Waser  was  given  an  opportunity  of  seeing  part  of  this  work  and  in  a  let-
ter  to  Damman,  written  from  Ayr  several  weeks  later  he  encouraged  him 
to  complete  and  publish  it5 6. 

On  12th  May  the  journey  was  continued  northward  across  the  Firth 

of  Forth  from  Leith  to  Kinghorn  and  then  to  St.  Andrews—a  day's  jour(cid:173)
ney.  To  St.  Andrews  the  visitors  took  with  them  an  introduction  to  An(cid:173)
drew  Melville57,  Rector  of  the  Üniversity,  from  William  Dundas,  the 
young  Baron  of  Fingask,  who  is  recorded  as  bachelor  of  St.  Andrews  in 
1579  and  who  was  active  at  court  during  the  first  half  of  this  decade5 8. 
At  St.  Andrews  the  travellers  received  a  warm  welcome  from  all  in 
authority  in  the  city  and  the  Üniversity.  Amongst  the  members  of  the 
Üniversity,  they were entertained by the Melvilles, Andrew and  Patrick5 9, 
David  Moneypenny6 0,  Dean  of  the  Faculty  of  Arts,  and  J o hn  Kennedy, 
Earl  of  Cassinis  (15671-1615),  a  student,  then  resident  in  St.  Mary's 
College61.  To  all  of  them  Waser  subsequently  wrote  letters,  which,  how-
ever,  have  not  survived,  but  one  from  Moneypenny  and  another  from 
Cassillis to Waser written in  1594 in reply have been preserved62.  Amongst 
those  of  the  town  whom  they  met,  David  Black63  and  Robert  Wallace64, 
the  ministers,  and  Captain  William  Murray6 5,  who  was  elected  Provost 
in  1594,  are  mentioned  in  subsequent  correspondence. 

The  visit  to  St.  Andrews  lasted  from  12th  to  17th  May.  Thereafter  the 
journey  northward  was  resumed.  A  night  was  spent  in  Dundee  and  one

at Montrose before they reached Aberdeen on 19th May. On the way from 
Arbroath  to Montrose they visited at his home at Easter  Seatown,  Peter 
Young66,  to  whom  they  would  have  brought  greetings  from  his  former 
teacher  in Geneva,  Theodore  Beza. 

At  Aberdeen  their  friendship  with  Robert  Howie was renewed.  Some-
thing of Howie's pleasure at the unexpected visit is revealed in the letters 
for  his friends  at  Basel,  which  he immediately  wrote  and which  he en-
trusted to Waser to deliver on his return to the Continent67. The visitors 
also met Peter  Blackburn68,  one of the ministers  and a former  colleague 
of Andrew Melville in the University  of Glasgow,  and Thomas  Cargill69, 
the  master  of  the  Grammar  School  of  New Aberdeen,  a  distinguished 
classical scholar. The Itinerary,  however,  records no details of this  visit. 
In  the German  version  there is merely  a note in Latin  which  states  that 
Aberdeen  was the 'patria'  of John  Jonston  and Robert  Howie70. 

The return journey to Edinburgh  was by way of Laurencekirk,  Forfar, 
Newtyle,  Perth  and Kinghorn.  At  Edinburgh  they  remained  from  25th 
May until  15th June,  apart  from  an excursion  on 9th and  lOth  June  to 
the  Bass  Rock.  Wedel had been  rowed  out to the  Rock  from  Tantallon 
Castle and had included in his Journal a lengthy description of the island 
with its multitudes of birds about which he had been told the tales famil(cid:173)
iär  to travellers  of  the period71.  No doubt  Waser  also  listened  to  them, 
but  he does  not  appear  to  have  considered  them  worthy  of notice. He 
merely  adds in the German  version  a prosaic  remark—they  are good to 
eat72. 

This  second  and  much  longer  visit  to  Edinburgh  coincided  with  the 
holding  of one of the most  notable  Scottish  Parliaments  of the  decade, 
that  which  witnessed  the  success  of  the  struggles  of  the  Presbyterian 
party  for the political recognition  of the form  of Church  government  set 
out  in the  Second Book  of Discipline.  The Acts,  which  have  sometimes 
been  regarded  as the  Golden  Charter  of  Presbyterians,  were  passed  by 
the  Estates  on  5th  June73.  Of all this,  however,  Waser  has nothing  to 
record. He only noted  that Hainzel had "paid  his respects"74 to the Par-

liament,  by  which  he  probably  meant  t h at  he  had  been  present  at  the 
opening  of  the  Session. 

On  löth  J u ne  the  journey  was  resumed  westwards,  slowly  at  first,  for 
on  that  day  they  travelled  no  further  than  Linlithgow.  The  next  night 
was  spent  at  Stirling.  The  weekend  of  17th  to  20th  J u ne  was  spent  in 
Glasgow,  apart  from  an  excursion  on  Sunday  to  the  important  fortress  at 
Dumbarton7 5.  Again,  all eise t h at  took  place is passed  over  in  silence,  but 
we  know  from  Waser's  letter  to  Damman  that  the  travellers  made  their 
presence  known  to  the  professors  of  the  University7 6. 

On  21st  J u ne  the  traveller  set  out  for  Ayr,  where  they  spent  five  days 
waiting  for  a  ship  and  suitable  weather  to  take  them  across  to  Dublin7 7. 
By  the  28th  they  decided  to  make  their  way  to  Kirkcudbright,  a  sea  port 
with  a  better  connection  for  Ireland.  The  route  taken  was  by  Cumnock 
and  Sanquhar  and  down  the  valley  of the  Nith  to  Dumfries  and  Kirkcud(cid:173)
bright  where  they  arrived  on  30th June. At  midnight  two  days  later  they 
sailed  for  Ireland  in  the  Company  of  a  certain  Thomas  Masson,  a  Citizen 
of  Kirkcudbright,  in  a  ship  manned  by  "two  wild  seafaring  men  from 
Knockfergus7 8".  In  the  morning  the  Mull  of  Galloway  was  sighted  and 
by  mid-day  they  were  passing  the  Isle  of  Man.  In  the  afternoon 
they 
landed  at  Carlingford,  spent  the  night  at  Drogheda  and  next  day  reached 
Dublin  where  they  remained  until  8th  July.  No  further  information  of 
this  brief  visit  to  Ireland  has  come  to  light. 

During  the  crossing  of  the  Irish  Sea  from  Dublin  to  Chester,  the  usual 
English  port  for  Ireland,  a  storm  was  encountered  which,  according  to 
Waser,  drove  the  ship  towards  the  coast  of  Cornwall!  The  next  day  they 
set  foot  once  again  on  English  soil  and  after  a  day's  rest  took  the  direct 
route,  Watling  Street,  to  London  where  they  arrived  on  17th  July  at  the 
end  of  six  days  of  continuous  travelling7 9. 

For  the  remaining  six  weeks  of  their  visit  London  was  their  head-
quarters  from  which  they  undertook  the  usual  excursions  made  by  for-
eign  travellers  to  the  royal  palaces  and  the  universities.  Of  the  visit  to 
the  palaces  the  itinerary  is  all  t h at  is  given80.  It  took  three  days.  Of  the

visit to Oxford  and Cambridge there is only the Latin record of the  journey 
and  in  the  German  version  a  brief  note  which  states  t h at  they  visited  the 
Colleges  and  at  Oxford  met,  amongst  others,  the  celebrated  Italian  Jurist 
Alberico  Gentili,  Regius  Professor  of  Civil  Law,  and  the  Aristotelian 
scholar,  John  Case,  and  at  Cambridge  the  highly  reputed  Puritan  divine, 
William  Whitaker8 1.  A  night  was  spent  in  both  cities. 

By  16th  August  Hainzel  and  his  tutor  had  returned  to  London  where 
they  remained  until  24th.  Some  time  during  the  tour  they  visited  Theo-
balds  Palace,  at  t h at  time  the  home  of  Lord  Burghley,  Secretary  and 
Lord  High  Treasurer8 2.  On  24th  they  sailed  from  Gravesend  and  on  26th 
landed  at  Flushing8 3. 

From  Flushing  they  travelled  through  the  Low  Countries,  met  Justus 
Lipsius  (1547-1606)  at  Louvain8 4,  and  then  moved  to  Cologne  where 
they  took  a  boat  up  the  Rhine  as far  as Mainz.  By  13th  October  they  had 
reached  Augsburg,  and  with  the  return  of  Hainzel  to  his  native  city  and 
his  home  the  first  part  of  his  Grand  Tour  with  his  tutor  ended8 5.  In  the 
following  month  they  had  taken  to  the  road  once  again  on  that  part  of 
their  Grand  Tour  which  took  them  to  Italy  and  which  ended  with  the 
return  of  Hainzel  and  Waser  to  Augsburg  toward  the  end  of  1593 86.  The 
Grand  Tour  had  been  accomplished,  and  Waser's  appointment  as  tutor 
brought  to  a  successful  conclusion. 

The  subsequent  career  of  Hainzel  has  not  been  traced.  Waser  on  his 
return  to  Zürich  was  ordained  to  the  ministry  and  in  1596  appointed  a 
Professor  at  the  Carolinum, 
the  theological  College  of  Zürich,  where  he 
remained  until  his  death  in  162587. 

According  to  the  figures  given  in  the  Latin  manuscript  and  Waser's 
calculations  his  travels  from  24th  May,  1591, until  13th  October,  1592, 
extended  to  718  German  miles,  of  which  391  had  been  traversed  in  Bri-
tain  and  of  this  number  just  over  100  German  miles  were  over  Scottish 
soil.  The  visit  to  the  British  Isles  had  lasted  thirty  five  weeks,  of  which 
eight  had  been  spent  in  Scotland.

It  is to  be  regretted  that  Waser  recorded  virtually  nothing  of his  im-
pressions  of  this  country  and  its  people.  Of his  impressions  of  England 
only  one  remark  has  been  found  in  a  letter  written  on  Ist  November, 
1593,  "0  pulchram  Angliam  prae  reliquis.  Hanc  et  tu  vidisses  vellem, 
imo  ex  animo  optarem  multis  de  causis88."  Along  with  other  travellers 
of this  period  Waser  had  undoubtedly  been  impressed  with  the  richness 
of  England's  parks  and  pastures. 

On his settlement  in Zürich, Waser  did not  forget  his Scottish  friends. 
As has already been stated, he is known to have written to some of those 
who had entertained him and his nobleman, in appreciation  of their kind-
ness towards them. From  1593 until  1607 he was a regulär  correspondent 
of  John  Johnston89.  None  of  Waser's  letters  to  Johnston  has,  however, 
come  to  light,  but  from  the  extant  autographs  of  Johnston's  letters  to 
him, on which he usually marked  the  date  of receipt  and  of his reply, we 
know of Waser's continued interest in this country and its aifairs.  Further 
evidence is found  in his translation  in  1603 into  German  of the  Negative 
Confession  of  158190 in  an  attempt  to  allay rumours  about  King  James' 
lack  of  constancy  in  the  Protestant  faith,  which  were  freely  circulating 
on  the  Continent.  In  1610  he  dedicated  to  King  James  his  edition  of 
Francis  Conrad  Graser's  Plaga  regia, sive  commentarius  in  Apocalypsin 
B.  Johannis91.  He does not  appear  to have maintained  a  correspondence 
with  Robert  Ho wie,  but  on  several  occasions  Johnston  sent  greetings 
from  him  to  Waser. 

The  extracts  taken  from  both  versions  of  the  Hodoeporica have  been

Note  A:  Waser's  note  on  the  text 

In  a  note  on  the  verso  of  the  title  page  of  the  Latin  Version92  Waser 
explained  that  cities,  towns  and  places  of  similar  size  and  importance 
were  indicated  by  capital  letters,  other  places  by  small  letters.  In  the 
German  Version  these  larger  places  have  not  been  capitalized  but  itali-
cized.  In  the  text  printed  these  distinctive  features  of  both  versions  have 
been  retained. 

Note  B:  Symbols  for  the  days  of  the  week 

In  order  to  indicate  the  day  of  the  week  Waser  added  after  the  date 
the  symbol  employed  in  manuscripts  from  the  fourteenth  Century  for  the 
planet  which  had  given  its  name  to  t h at  day9 3.  As  a  key  to  the  Symbols

93 In  the  seven  day  week,  which  in its  origin is  connected  with  the  dogma  that 
every  period  of  time  including  the  day  had  a  planet  for  its  regent,  each  day  was 
assigned to  one of the five planets reoognized  in ancient  Ptolomaic  astronomy  and 
of  the  moon  and  the  sun.  Hence  the  Latin  names  for  the  days  of  the  week. [See

Note  C: 

In  the  Latin  version  Waser  has  recorded  the  places  where  meals  were 
taken.  As  far  as  was  practicable  the  normal  sixteenth  Century  pattern  of 
two  meals  a  day,  prandium 
(taken  about  the  middle  of  the  day)  and 
coena  (taken  at  the  end  of  the  afternoon),  was  followed.  On  the  ride  from 
London  to  Scotland,  however,  whenever  it  was  not  certain  t h at  they 
would  arrive  at  a  suitable  stopping  place  for  prandium, 
a  lighter  meal, 
jentaculum, 
taken  before  setting  out,  was  substituted.  An  exception  was 
made  on  the  day  of  the  longest  ride  of  the  tour,  t h at  from  Berwick  to 
Edinburgh;  three  meals, jentaculum,  prandium 

and  coena  are  noted. 

Note  D: 

At  the  extreme  right  hand  side  of  the  page  in  the  Latin  version  Waser 
set  down  the  distances  between  the  places  mentioned  in  accordance  with 
the  System  of measurement  used  in  the  country  through  which  they  were 
passing,  and  at  the  end  of  the  document  compiled  a  table  in  which  the 
totals  for  several  countries  were  converted  into  German  miles  to  give  a 
grant  total  for  the  tour. 

Waser  defined  a  German  mile  as  the  distance  which  a  man  Walking 
swiftly  should  cover in two  hours9 4,  and  a  Belgian  mile t h at  which  should 
be  covered  in  one hour9 5.  The  English  mile  was  much  shorter.  In  the  text 
Waser  stated  t h at  four  or  five  English  miles  made  one  German  mile96, 
but  in  his  conversion  of  English  miles  into  German  miles  he  took  four 
English  miles  as  equivalent  to  one9 7. 

For  the  distance  given  in  the  English  part  of  the  itinerary,  Waser  may 
have used  one  of several  tables  of itineraries  currently  available  to  travel-

1  Flushing, "the key to the navigation of the North Seas", was held and garrison-
ed  by  the  English  as  a  "cautionary  town",  from  1585.  (J.L.  Motley,  The  United 
Netherlands, London  1904,  1.382ff.) 

2 Daniel de Dieu (1540-1607), Protestant theologian and pastor at Flushing  from 

1585 until  his death  (Biographie  National de Belgique,  16.63ff.). 

3  Sir  Robert  Sidney  (1563-1626),  subsequently  Viscount  Lisle  and  flrst  Earl  of 
Leicester, was Governor of Plushing from 1588 to  1616 (D.N.B. 52.236f.; Complete 
Peerage,  7.553f.) 

4 Gravesend,  the  usual haven  for  those travelling  to  and  from  the  Continent  by 
the  North  Sea.  Hentzner,  in  1598, writes  of  Gravesend  as  "a  small  town,  famous 
for  the  convenience of its port;  the largest  Dutch  ships usually  call here".  (Quoted 
in W. B. Eye, England as seen by Poreigners in the days of Elizabeth and James the 
Pirst,  London  1965, 183.) 

5 The  royal  palaee  of  Greenwich,  where  Queen  Elizabeth  was  born.  Hentzner's 
interesting  desoription  of his visit  to  the  Palaoe in  1598 is given  in  Eye,  103-107. 
See also B.8.  Bau,  Royal Palaces of England, London  1911, 51-60, and /.  Dunlop,

The  distances  between  Kirkcudbright  and Carlingford  and between  Dub(cid:173)

converted  to  thirty  German  miles.  The  distance  between  Flushing  and 
Gravesend  is, on p. 138, as one hundred  and  twenty  English  miles,  and is 
converted  into  thirty  German  miles.  A  further  error  has been  noted.  On 
p.  130 no figure  is given  for the distance  between  Gravesend  and  London 
b ut  on  p.  138 fourteen  miles  are  added  for  this  part  of the  journey.

6 The Great Hall of Westminster  Palace, built by William  Rufus  and altered by 
Richard  II  in  1399. In  1512 the  palace  suffered  greatly  from  Are and  thereafter 
ceased  to be used  as a royal  residence. For a  brief  description  written  in  1592 by 
John Norden see Rye, 96f. See also Rait, 23ff. and Dunlop, 59f. Waser is undoubtedly 
referring  not  only  to  Westminster  Hall  but  to  the  Palace  of Whitehall,  situated 
within the precinets of the old Palace.

the  time  of  Henry  III,  took  place  near  Keswick  in  the  reign  of  Queen  Elizabeth. 
In  1565 the mines jumped into prominence as the most lucrative veins of copper in

the  kingdom.  The  work  was  supervised  by  Daniel  "Hechstetter"  (1572),  from 
Augsburg, who brought with him from  Germany four hundred men. His widow died 
in 1610. A son, Daniel, was born in  1572 and an Emanuel Hechstetter  is mentioned 
in  1597.  The  family  intermarried  and  had  descendents  who  played  a  prominent 
part in the North  of England. [The Victoria History  of the County of  Cumberland,

30  In  the  Introduction,  p. 265,1 have  accepted  as  correct  the  reading  of the  Latin 
version,  as  a  visit  of  six  weeks  at  Keswick  is  more  understandable  than  a  stay  at 
Newcastle  of  about  six  weeks  of  which  nothing  is  known. 

31  Probably  Lanercost,  where  there  was  in  Leland's  time  an  abbey  of  Black

33  Newcastle, described by  Camden  as "the glory of all the Towns in this  Country", 
and  "in  a most  flourishing  State  of wealth  and  commerce"  (2.1088). It  was  originally 
the  strongest  fortress  in  the  North  of  England.  The  distances  from  Newcastle  to 
Berwick  are  the  same  as  those  given  by  Harrison,  2.110. 

34  Alnwick,  "Market  towne".  Leyland's  Itinerary,  5.63.  See  also  Camden,  2.1094. 
35  Berwick,  described  by  Camden  as  "the  last  town  in  England  and  the  best 
fortified  in  all  England",  had,  according  to  Hector  Boece,  Scotorum  Historiae  Prima 
Gentis  Origine,  Paris  1574,  been  restored  to  the  Scots  in  perpetuity  by  Henry  VI, 
but  did  not  long remain  in Scottish  hands. In  the reign  of Elizabeth  its  fortifications 
were  strengthened,  and  the  Castle, of  which  little now remains, was  garrisoned  until 
the  union  of  the  Crowns  in  1603. [Camden,  2.1099;  /.  Scott,  Berwick  upon  Tweed, 
History  of  the  Town  and  Guild,  London  1888,  chapter  10;  Encyclopaedia  Britan-
nica,  Eleventh  Edition,  3.817.] 

36  Henry  Carey  (1617),  Baron  Hundson,  was  appointed  Governor  of  Berwick 
from  1568 but  was  in  the  South  in  1591-92. The  Deputy  Governor  and  Marshai  was 
Sir  Henry  Widdrington,  to  whom  Waser  undoubtedly  refers.  [Complete  Peerage, 
6.630;  12.625f.;  D.N.B.,  9.68f.;  Calendar  of  State  Papers,  Scotland,  10  (1589-

40  Seton  Palace,  built  at  different  periods  "exoelled  in  taste  and  eleganoe  any 
other  mansion  of the  16th  or  17th Century, was esteemed  muoh the  most  magnificent 
Castle  in  Scotland.  Its  gardens  and  terrace  walks,  as  well  as  its  splendid  inferior, 
were  the  delight  of  kings".  (Oroome,  3.336.) 

41  Robert,  sixth  Lord  Seton  and  first  Earl  of  Winton  (1552-1603),  succeeded  in 
January  1586  his  father,  George  Seton  (for  long  a  loyal  supporter  of  Mary  Queen 
of  Scots),  whom  he  had  sometimes  accompanied  on  missions  to  France.  Robert 
Seton,  a  personal  friend  of James  VI, was  a  member  of the  Privy  Council.  " He  kept 
a  very  hospitable  house,  where  the  King  and  Queen,  as  well  as  French  and  other 
ambassadors,  and  strangers  of  quality,  were  nobly  and  frequently  entertained."  In 
1589,  when  King  James  went  to  Denmark  to  bring  back  his  bride,  Seton  was  ap-
pointed  one  of  the  Council  of  Regency.  He  was  elevated  to  an  Earldom,  with  the 
title of Earl  of Winton  in November  1600. [O. Seton,  History  of the  Family  of  Seton, 
Edinburgh  1896,  1.203flf.;  B.O.  Seton,  The  House  of  Seton,  Edinburgh  1939, 
1.173ff.] 

42  Dalkeith.  At  Dalkeith,  James,  fourth  Earl  of  Morton  and  Regent  during  the 
minority  of King James  VI,  built  in  1575 "a  magnificent  palace richly  adorned  with 
tapestries  and  pictures,  and  fitter  for  a  king  than  a  subject"  (Oroome,  1.336).  From 
the  end  of  February  1592  to  May  1592  King  James  appears  to  have  resided  fre(cid:173)
quently  at  Dalkeith  Palace. [Register  of the  Privy  Council  of  Scotland,  ed.  D.  Mas-
son,  4.1xvi.] 

43  A  clear  indication  that  the  German  version  had  been  composed  after 

the 

accession  of  King  James  to  the  English  throne  in  1603. 

44  Colonel  William  Stewart  of  Houston  (fl.  1575-1603),  who  had  served  in  the 
Low  Countries  as  a  soldier,  was  in  1582  appointed  captain  of  the  King's  guard  and 
in  1583  a  member  of  the  privy  Council.  For  a  time  he  was  out  of  favour  but  later 
commanded  the  six  ships  commissioned  to  bring  back  the  King  and  Queen  from 
Denmark.  In  the  summer  of  1590  he  was  sent  as  an  ambassador  to  the  princes  of 
Germany.  On his return  he was handsomely  rewarded  by  the King  on  12th  January, 
1591.  Subsequently  he  was  sent  on  several  foreign  missions.  He  was  knighted  in 
1594. [D.N.B., 54.362ff.;  J.  Ferguson,  The Scots Brigade  in the  Service of the  United 
Netherlands,  Scottish  History  Society,  Edinburgh  1899,  l.llöff.]  Stewart  had  some 
few  years  earlier  entertained  Lupoid  von Wedel.  [Transactions  Royal  Historical  So(cid:173)
ciety,  New  Series,  9,  1895, 247.]  In  the  letter  of  dedication  of  his  edition  of  Conrad 
Graser's  Plaga  Regia  (Zürich  1610),  Waser  attributed  his  introduction  to  King 
James  to  Peter  Young.  He  wrote:  "Accedit  his  omnibus  singularis  dementia,  qua

the  signatures  and  armorial  bearings  of the  owner's  friends  and  acquaintanoes  as  he 
moved  from  one University  or  country  to  another.  Many  of them  contained  in  addi-
tion  to  signatures,  classioal  or  biblical  quotations  or  other  literary  matter.  A  large 
number  of  examples  have  survived  but  that  of  Hainzel  has  not  been  traced.  For

46  Thomas  Seggate  (c.  1570-1628),  a  graduate  of  the  seeond  olass  of  Edinburgh 
University  in  1588.  The  following  year  he  studied  at  Leiden  under  Justus  Lipsius 
and  returned  to  Scotland  to  become  tutor  to  the  children  of  Lord  Seton.  Later  he 
left  for  the  Continent  where  he  spent  the  remainder  of  his  life.  His  name  ocours  in 
the list of Scottish students at Padua for the year 1597-98. On 26th July, 1597, Lipsius 
sent  him  a  glowing  testimonial.  He  was  received  into  the  family  of  Pinelli,  an  en-
lightened  and  generous  patron  of literature,  and  is  mentioned  as  one  of the  literary 
friends  of Laurentius  Pignorius.  In  1614 he was  at  Frankfurt-am-Main.  Seggate  was 
known  to  Dempster,  who  described  him  as  "antiquarius,  Graece  Latineque  doc-
tissimus".  [A  Catalogue  of  the  Graduates  of  the  University  of  Edinburgh,  Edin(cid:173)

49  St.  Andrews. 
50  The  University,  founded  in  1411,  had  in  1592  three  Colleges—St.  Salvator's, 
founded  in  1450, St.  Leonard's  in  1512, and  St. Mary's  College in  1538. [See  further 
B.O.  Cant,  The  University  of  St.  Andrews,  Edinburgh  1946,  22ff.] 

51 Andrew  Melvüle  (1545-1622),  Rector  of the  University,  Principal  of  St.  Mary's 
College  from  1580  until  1606.  Melville  was  one  of  the  outstanding  Scottish  educa-
tional  and  ecclesiastical  leaders  of  his  time.  He  was  well-known  on  the  Continent, 
and  had  studied  at  Paris,  Poitiers  and  Geneva,  where  he  had  also  taught.  [T.Mc-
Crie,  Life  of  Andrew  Melville,  Edinburgh  1856.] 

52  See  supra  p.  267. 
53  William Dundas  (fl. 1580-1600), son of Arohibald  Dundas of Fingask,  graduated 
at  St.  Andrews  in  1579. His  name  occurs  in  the  "Register  of  the  Privy  Council"  as 
"apparent  of  Fingask"  in  1591.  During  1594  he  is  mentioned  frequently  as  "the 
young  Barron  of  Fingass"  in  the  "Calendar  of  State  Papers,  Scotland",  and  in 
"Letters  of  John  Colville".  In  the  same  year  he  accompanied  Edward  Bruce, 
Titular  Abbot  of  Kinloss,  on  a  mission  to  England.  Thereafter  he  appears  on  the 
Continent  as  the  friend  of  Karl  von  Zerotin,  with  whom,  it  has  been  suggested,  he 
became  acquainted  at  Geneva.  Dundas  had in all probability  gone abroad  with  John 
Ruthven,  Earl of Gowrie, late in  1594 or early in  1595, for  at  some time in the  middle 
of  the  decade  he  introduced  Ruthven  to  Zerotin.  He  did  not  return  with  Ruthven 
to  Scotland  in  1599, and,  perhaps,  as  a  result  of the  events  of August  1600,  decided 
to  remain  abroad.  His  younger  brother  Arohibald  was  granted  succession  to  the 
family  estates  of  Fingask  in  February  1606.  [Reg.  P.C.  Scot.,  4.623;  Calendar  of 
State  Papers,  Scotland,  11.331,  347,  373,  377,  387;  Letters  of  John  Colville  1582-
1603,  ed.  D.  Laing,  Bannatyne  Club,  Edinburgh  1858,  103,  106,  109f.,  where  he  is 
wrongly  identified  as Alexander  Dundas;  H.M.C.  Salisbury  Mss., 4.547ff.,  5.9,  5.17;

54  We  should  probably  read  26  miles  here.  Harrison's 

total  for  the  route  from 

Kinghorn  to  St.  Andrews  was  27  miles  (2.116).

68 Peter  Young  (1544-1628),  nephew  of  Henry  Scrimger,  Professor  of  Law  at 
Geneva,  was  educated  probably  at  St. Andrews  University  and  at  Geneva  where 
his name occurs on the first page of the Matriculation Register of the newly founded 
Academy  in  1559. Ten  years later  he was appointed  joint-instructor  of the  young 
James  VI  along with  the  oelebrated  Scottish  humanist  George Buchanan.  In  1580 
he  purchased  the  estate  of  Easter  Seatown,  near  Arbroath,  and  three  years  later 
built  a  mansion  there,  of  which  only  one  stone  with  the  date  and  the  initials  of 
himself and his first wife is in existenoe, built into the farmhouse  that  now occupies 
its site. From 1586 Young was often employed by King James on foreign embassies.

61 Cowie.  "A  free  burgh",  now  part  of  Stonehaven,  standing  on  the  north  aide 
of  the  bay.  Waser,  along  with  Camden (2.1257),  was  mistaken  in  placing  Cowie 
south of  Dunnottar. 

62 Dunnottar.  Waser  is referring  to  Dunnottar  Castle, now  a  ruined  fortress  on 
the  ooast  of  the  parish  of  Dunnottar  1 %  miles south  by  east  of  Stonehaven,  and 
regarded  by  Groome  as  "one  of  the  most  majestio  ruins in  the  kingdom".  During 
the sixteenth and seventeenth  centuries it was the chief seat of the Earls Marischal 
(Camden,  2.1257; Groome,  1.442).

Taylor, the Water poet, who travelled in Scotland in  1618, in his desoription of the 
Bass,  made  special  mention  of  "the  soleand  goose,  a  most  delicate  fowle,  which 
breeds  in  great  abundance  ...  it  is very  good  flesh".  Waser  was in  all  probability 
acquainted with the detailed desoription and drawing of the Solan goose of the Bass 
in  Conrad  Gesner's  "Historiae  Animalium",  Zürich  1555, 3.158. [P. Hume  Brown,

ticarum  Historiae,  Frankfurt  am  Main  1594,  26.  Neither  Buchanan  nor  Camden 
(2.1439f.)  mention the Druids in  connection with the Isle  of Man, but  Waser  may 
have been dependent  on Boece  (Scotorum  Historiae  prima  gentis  origine, 22), who 
does, and  who was followed  by Spottiswoode.  [History  of  the Church  of  Scotland, 
Spottiswoode  Society,  Edinburgh  1851, 1.4if.] The  title  "King  of Man"  was  given 
up  by Thomas III  (1504-1521), of the  House  of  Stanley,  but  the  island  continued 
to regard itself as a Kingdom. (A. W. Moore, History of the Isle of Man; E.H.  Sten-
ning,  Isle of Man, 37.)  "The right of being crowned with  a golden  crowne" is men-
tioned  in  1393. [J. Train,  Historical  and  Statistical  Account  of  the  Isle  of  Man, 
1845, 1.153.]

to  Camden, fifteen  miles (2.1393).

land"  but in Camden's day "its doom was sealed" and Liverpool had beoome "the 
most  convenient  and usual  place for  setting  sail for  Ireland"  (Darby, 372ff.). The 
route  from  Chester to London  is that  given in the French  "Guide de Chemins" of 
1571, and in Harrisem,  2.111 (see Map in Darby, 342, Fig. 64). Apart  from  the dist(cid:173)

mileage is the same as in Harrison.

loa Visits  to  the royal  palaces  in the  counties  surrounding  London  and to the

123  According  to  Camden  (1.307ff.,  481ff.),  there  were  sixteen  Colleges at  both  Ox(cid:173)

ford  and  Cambridge. 

124 William  Whitaker  (1548-1595), Master  of St.  John's  College, Cambridge  1586-
95,  and  a  highly  respected  Puritan  and  Calvinist.  [D.N.B.,  61.21;  Cross,  Oxford 
Dictionary  of  the  Christian  Church,  London  1957,  1454.] 

126 J o hn  Case (1600), Fellow of  St. John's College, Oxford,  theologian,  philosopher 
and  musician.  His  fame  was  made  as  a  commentator  on  Aristotle.  One  of his  books, 
published  in  1585,  was  the  first  book  printed  in  Oxford  by  the  University  Press, 
and  was  so  highly  valued  that  in  1590  every  Bachelor  of  Arts  was  ordered  to  buy 
one  on  taking  his  degree.  He  is remembered  as  one  who  gave  his  College fame  in  its 
early  years.  [D.N.B.,  9.262;  W.H.  Hutton,  S. John  Baptist  College,  Oxford  Uni(cid:173)
versity  College  Histories,  London  1898,  64ff.] 

12« Alberico  Gentili  (1552-1608),  Regius  Professor  of  Civil  Law  at  Oxford  from 
1587,  was  one  of  the  earliest  systematic  writers  on  international  law.  He  settled  in 
England  as a religious refugee  in  1580 and  began teaching  at  Oxford  in the  following 
year.  In  1586  he  accompanied  the  embassy  of  Sir  Horatio  Pallavicino  to  Germany 
but  returned  to  Oxford  to  beoome  Professor  of  Civil  Law.  (D.N.B.,  21.124ff.) 

i27  The  route  from  Cambridge  to  London  is  given  in  the  reverse  order  with  the 

same  distanees  by  Harrison,  2.114f.
