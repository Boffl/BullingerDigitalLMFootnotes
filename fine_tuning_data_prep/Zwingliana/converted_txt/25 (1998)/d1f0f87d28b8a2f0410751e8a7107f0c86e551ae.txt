Controlling  the  Clergy 

The Oversight  of Basel's Rural Pastors in the Sixteenth  Century 

by  AMY NELSON BURNETT 

Recent research has highlighted Heinrich Bullinger's role in shaping the insti-
tutional structures of the Zürich church, and particularly his use of the synod 
for overseeing clerical discipline.1 Bullinger's forceful  personality and his fruit-
ful  personal  relationships  with  several  members  of  the  Zürich  Senate,  com-
bined with his lengthy tenure of office,  gave him an unusually strong position 
from which to direct the Zürich church and to oversee its personnel.2 The Basel 
church was not  so fortunate  in the half-century  after  the death  of its  «found-
ing father,»  Johannes  Oecolampadius, in  1531. Oswald  Myconius,  the  Basel 
Antistes  from  1531-1552, was  acutely  conscious  of  his  own  deficiencies  and 
oversensitive  to  any  perceived  slight  from  his  counterparts  in  Zürich  and 
Geneva.3 Myconius' successor, Simon Sulzer, was increasingly handicapped by 
doctrinal strife within the city and  by Basel's alienation  from  its fellow  evan-
gelical  Swiss  cities, both  the  result  of  Sulzer's  Lutheran  leanings.  Only  after 
Sulzer's death in 1585 and the selection of Johann Jakob  Grynaeus  as the new 
Antistes  did  the  Basel  church  gain  a leader  whose  organizational  skills  and 
unquestioned  orthodoxy  gave  him  the  same  authority  that  Bullinger  had 
enjoyed  in  Zürich.  During  his  first  fifteen  years  in  office,  Grynaeus  Consol(cid:173)
idated the various methods used by his predecessors to create an effective  hier-
archical  structure  for  clerical  oversight.  How  did  this  structure  evolve  in  a 
church  that  lacked  a charismatic  and  influential  leader  for  much  of  the  six(cid:173)
teenth  Century? 

In theory at least, the basis of clerical discipline in Basel, as in Zürich, was 
the  synod.  The  Basel  Reformation  Ordinance  of  1529  specified  that  synods 
were  to  be held  semiannually,  although  after  Oecolampadius'  death  in 1531, 
the synods met only once a year for the remainder of the decade. The purpose

of  the  synod,  according  to  the  Reformation  Ordinance,  was  to  give  each 
minister the opportunity to report unacceptable beliefs or behavior on the part 
of  his colleagues  to the  appropriate  authorities.4 The protocols  from  the  ear-
liest synods  State that  each  of the pastors  attending  the meeting was  certified 
as «suitable for preaching the word of God and accepted as pastors,»  although 
a few pastors were approved  only on condition that  «they study further»  and 
told  that if they  did  not  do better  at the next  synod, they would  be  removed 
from  their posts.5 

Over time, however, the synodal certification  of the pastors seems to have 
become  a formality.  Increasingly  over  the  course  of  the  1530s the  synod  be-
came  an  opportunity  for  all  of  the  clergy  «in  Stadt  und  Land»  to  complain 
about their parishioners: they were not attending  church, they were guilty of 
religious  sins  such  as blasphemy  and  swearing  as well  as moral  offenses  like 
drunkenness  and  gambling. They  showed  no  respect  for  the pastors, for  the 
word  of  God,  or  for  the  sacraments  of  baptism  and  the  Lord's  Supper.  The 
pastors were especially concerned about the young people who did not  attend 
catechism  instruction,  and  they  complained  that  those  who  did  come  to  the 
catechetical  Services  were  not  old  enough  to  understand  what  was  being 
taught.6 The  blame for  these failings  was implicitly  placed  on the  magistrate: 
the  church  ordinances  and  other  Statutes were  not  being  enforced,  the  rural 
officials  were negligent in their duties, and the ban was not  being  imposed.7 
Initially the Senate was willing to work with the pastors  and regularly re-
ferred  their  grievances to a committee  for  further  consideration,  but  by  1537 
it  had  lost  patience  with  the  pastors'  constant  stream  of  complaints.  In  a 
sharply-worded  rebuke to the clergy gathered in synod that year, the Senate's 
representatives  noted  that  the  pastors'  complaints  made  it  seem  like  the 
problems in the parishes were entirely the fault  of the magistrate. Despite  the 
importance  of  the  office  of  preacher,  there  were  never  any  complaints  made 
about the pastors, their wives and children, «so that one would think that they 
all live in highest  innocence.»  Nevertheless, it could  not  be denied  that  some 
of  them  «lived such  irresponsible  lives, others were  so incapable  in  teaching, 
some governed their wives and children so poorly,» that their ministries  bore

no fruit. The Senators pointed out these problems, «not that we hereby excuse 
our  own  negligence, but  because it is good also to punish these faults, so that 
the  one  party,  complaining  of  its  own  poverty,8  presents  itself  without  guilt 
and  thinks  that  only  the  magistrate  has  sinned.»  Indeed,  the  magistrate  had 
defended  some  of  its  less  capable  pastors  before  their  parishioners  and  had 
shown  patience  with  their  faults.  This  State  of  affairs  could  not  continue; 
henceforth  the Senate would be willing to accept the pastors' list of  grievances 
only if the pastors  first  submitted  to a strict censure.9 

This  rebuke  chastened  the pastors  somewhat,  for  the following  year  they 
modified  the tone of  their  grievance list, stating  that  it was presented  merely 
in  order  to  inform  the  magistrate  of  problems  in  the  church,  rather  than  to 
accuse or criticize anyone.10 Such assurances did not impress the Senate, how-
ever, for  in  1539 it issued  a new  synodal  and  ban  ordinance prescribing  how 
the yearly  synods  were  to  be called  and  conducted.  Although  the  ordinance 
acknowledged that the synod would include discussion of problems facing the 
church  and  how  to  deal with  them, it was  clear  that  the  primary  purpose  of 
the  gathering  was  to  examine  the  teaching  and  conduct  of  each pastor.  Min(cid:173)
isters who did not attend the synod, who were found  sorely lacking as a result 
of  the  examination,  or who  refused  to  accept  admonition  given at the  synod 
were  to  be  removed  from  office.  Only  after  the  clergy  had  been  examined 
would  the  Senators  listen  to  the  pastors'  concerns  and  suggestions  «for  the 
improvement  of  the church;»  they would  then pass  their  own  recommenda-
tions on to the füll  Senate.11 

The pastors  objected  to the ordinance's prescription  of this  publicly-con-
ducted  censure, but  to  no  avail, for  the  Senate  refused  to  modify  the  proce-
dure.12 Most of the pastors had little to fear from  the censure, however, for  the 
censures that survive from the synods of the 1540s show few complaints about 
their  conduct.13  On  the  other  hand,  although  the pastors  continued  to  com-
plain  about  the dire State of affairs  in their parishes, the Senate was  unmoved 
by those complaints. As a Senate committee told the pastors in 1542, «although 
it  is  true  that  we  have  many  rebellious  and  malicious  people,  it  is  (God  be 
praised) also true that the affairs  of religion, and  Christian  being and  conduct 

8  One of the specific complaints presented for the first time in 1537 was the poverty of the rural 
clergy, who were unable to support their family  on their salaries. The pastors had asked  that 
they be given additional support from  the income generated by church property now  admin-
istered  by the  magistrate.

is in a better  State here than in many  other places, both under  the papacy  and 
where the Gospel is preached.»14 

The  new  complacency  of  the  Senate  may  have  been  due  to  its use  of  an-
other mechanism, a general Visitation, to gather information  about the condi-
tion of the church in its rural territories. The first Protestant Visitation in Basel's 
rural territories actually dated to before  the official  adoption of the  Reforma(cid:173)
tion: in the fall of  1528, Oecolampadius  had his deacon visit the parishes  with 
evangelically-minded clergy.15 At the first synod, held in May of 1529, the rural 
pastors  had requested  another Visitation, but  instead  of  calling a general Visi(cid:173)
tation the Senate appointed the Liestal pastor Hans Bruwiler as dean or Super(cid:173)
intendent  of the rural church  and ordered  him to meet four  times a year  with 
all of the clergy.16 There was no further  mention of visitations until the synods 
of  1537 and  1538, when  the pastors  again requested  that yearly visitations  be 
conducted in the rural districts by the Antistes, so that reform  measures could 
more easily be promoted there.17 Finally the Senate decreed in 1538 that a Visi(cid:173)
tation  should  be held in all of the rural districts, in place of the second  yearly 
synod prescribed  by the Reformation  Ordinance, «so that [the urban  pastors] 
will learn what is necessary to amend the administration of the church, its min-
isters and  anything  eise and be able to improve them.»18 

In accordance with the Senate's decree, Oswald Myconius was sent to visit 
the rural  churches  in  1539.'9 The need  for  more formal  guidelines  resulted  in 
the drafting  of a brief  ordinance in preparation  for  the second Visitation, held 
in April,  1541.20 The Visitation was to be conducted  by two  Senators and  one 
of the city's pastors. These officials  did not visit every parish but went only to 
the main village in each district, where they met with the Obervogt  or  district 
governor and all of the pastors and village officials  from that district. The most 
important  dement  of  the Visitation  was  the  censure, not  only  of  the  pastors

but also of the local officials.  In essence, the visitations resembled synods held 
on the local level. There was one important  difference,  however, between  the 
Visitation  and  the  general yearly  synod:  by  extending  the  censure  to  include 
district  and local officials,  the Visitation put pressure on these secular  officials 
to enforce  the edicts governing the religious and moral  conduct of the laity. 

Such a use of the Visitation would be possible only if detailed records were 
kept  of  the  findings,  but  for  the  remainder  of  Myconius'  tenure  as Antistes, 
documentation  of  synods  and visitations  feil  to  a bare minimum. No  reports 
were kept  of  the three visitations  held  in  1546, 1549 and  1551, and very  little 
was preserved  from  the  only  two  synods  to  be held  before  Myconius'  death 
in 1552.21 The Situation changed  dramatically with the selection of Simon Sul(cid:173)
zer as his successor. In April of  1554 a Visitation was held in the rural districts, 
and all urban and rural pastors met in synod the following year. In 1557 a synod 
was  held  for  the  urban  clergy,  and  a  delegation  was  sent  to  visit  the  rural 
pastors. Synods were also held in  1558 and  1559 for  all of Basel's pastors.22 

In accordance with the Synod  Ordinance  of  1539 these synods included a 
censure  of  the  clergy,23 but  again  the  censures  were perfunctory.  There  were 
no complaints about most of the pastors, and the few offenses  mentioned  were 
trivial: some pastors' sermons were too long, others were spending too  much 
time in the city or not devoting enough time to their studies. The reports con-
cerning  the  rural  parishes  were  not  so  positive.  On  the  contrary,  both  the 
district  officials  and  the rural pastors  repeated  the  same litany  of  complaints 
that had been submitted  at the synods of the 1530s. And as the pastors  attend-
ing the synods  of the  1530s had done, the new generation of Basel clergy also 
drew up lists of synodal articles for the Senate recommending stricter  enforce-
ment of morals legislation and closer oversight of local and district officials  to 
see that  they performed  their  duties. They  also presented  a series  of  recom-

21  This is not just  a case of documents  disappearing  over the intervening centuries. In  1601 the 
rural deans reported  to  the  Kirchenrat  that  after  searching the records  of the  Sisgau  chapter, 
they  found  only  the  dates  and  names  of  the visitors  for  the  three  visitations; BStA  Kirchen

mendations  concerning  the  administration  of  the  church's  wealth  for  poor 
relief, for funding  schools, and for assisting those pastors who were too old or 
sick to carry out their duties.24 It is clear that the leadership of the Basel church 
was using the synods and visitations not only to gather Information  about the 
State of the church but also to «encourage» the magistrate to enact certain poli-
cies. 

The Senate did not regard these recommendations  by the clergy any  more 
favorably  than  had  their  counterparts  of  the  previous  generation  -  in  part 
because they cast doubts on the Senate's accountability in dealing with  church 
funds. In October of 1560 all the city pastors were summoned to hear a stinging 
response from  representatives  of the Senate. They were chastised for  slander-
ing honorable  people with  their  sermons, using the pulpit  to  «drag in  recent 
news  or  other  things,»  and  in  general  for  «concerning  themselves  too  much 
with  secular things, like recent news, foreign  affairs  and secular business  that 
belongs  to  the  magistrate,  and  thereby  neglecting  their  studies.»  The  Senate 
was  willing  to  work  with  the  clergy  to  abolish  vice,  but  the  failings  of  the 
clerical estate also had to be addressed.25 The Senate's  edict was clearly  meant 
to put the pastors in their place, and to remind them that the ultimate  author-
ity  in  ecclesiastical  affairs  was the  magistrate,  and  not  the  clergy  gathered  in 
synod. 

The Basel pastors evidently learned their lesson, for there were no  compa-
rable synods held during the next two decades. The church's leaders had  good 
reason  to  avoid  the  holding  of  a synod,  since  a meeting  of  the  entire  clerical 
corps would  have worsened  the  growing  doctrinal  disagreements  in  the  city 
by bringing the opposing parties out into the open. In  1563 Sulzer had  signed 
the  Augsburg  Confession  while  brokering  a reconciliation  between  Johann 
Marbach and Girolamo Zanchi in Strasbourg, a move which prompted an out-
cry among Reformed  church leaders in Switzerland and resulted in a complete 
breakdown  in  Sulzer's  relations  with  Heinrich  Bullinger  and  the  Zürich 
church. Basel's alienation from its Reformed  Swiss allies was increased in 1566, 
when  Sulzer prevented  the Basel church  from  endorsing the Second  Helvetic 
Confession.26 Sulzer's actions did not go unopposed in Basel, however, and the 
city's  clergy were increasingly  divided  between  his supporters  and his  oppo-
nents. The only synod to meet during this period, called in the wake of a doc-

trinal  dispute  that  rocked  the  university  and  church  in  1571, was  carefully 
orchestrated  to prevent further  public disagreement  among the pastors.27 

Rather  than  holding  further  synods, the  Senate  chose  to  call a Visitation, 
held in 1572, to examine the State of the rural churches. For the first time, de-
tailed protocols were kept of the Visitation in each district, but these protocols 
suggest that the visitors did not go looking for specific problems, nor did they 
find  anything  that  they  considered  worrisome.  As  with  the  synods  of  the 
1550s, the overall view of the pastors was positive, and  even the reports  con-
cerning the laity had few serious complaints.28 The tone of the Visitation reports 
in  general  and  the  specific  types  of  complaints  noted  in  them  imply  that  the 
Standards  set by  the visitors  for  both  the  clergy  and  the  laity were none  too 
rigorous. The Visitation was still intended more as a source of Information  than 
as an instrument  of either social or confessional  control. 

The visitors of 1572 may have been too sanguine about the State of the rural 
church, however. By the end of the decade the rural pastors were complaining 
that vice was increasing out of hand. They argued that it was necessary to hold 
another Visitation which would  impress  on the laity the importance  of  obey-
ing the  Senate's  edicts and  would  encourage  the local  and  district  officials  to 
better  enforcement  of  those  edicts.29 At  the  same time the  doctrinal  tensions 
among  the clergy  had  again reached  the point  where  the Senate feit  it neces(cid:173)
sary to intervene. The result was another synod in May of  1581, where for  the 
first  time complaints were raised  about  several pastors  (including Sulzer)  be-
lieved to harbor Lutheran sympathies. The Senate clearly did not wish the doc(cid:173)
trinal  antipathies  to  continue;  it  not  only  repeated  but  also  intensified  the 
criticisms of the clergy it had first  made in 1560.30 

The synod  of  1581 marked  a turning point for  the city's church.  Over  the 
next  decade, the  magistrate  and  the church  leaders  in the city  again began  to 
take a vital interest in the rural church.  In  1582 a team of visitors was sent  to 
each  of  the  districts  in  the  rural  territories.  For  the  first  time  several  of  the 
pastors  and  parish  officials  complained  about  the  use  of  magic  and  the  con-
sultation of wise women, the practices surrounding burials, and the holding of

spinning bees.31 Since none of these problems had appeared in the 1572 Visita(cid:173)
tion report, it is apparent that the visitors were now asking specifically  about 
them.32  The  use  of  a list  of  questions  in  1582 was  a significant  Step  towards 
making the visitations a more effective  means of social and clerical control. The 
questions  highlighted practices that the visitors considered  to be problematic 
but that individual pastors might not have thought significant enough to report 
voluntarily  in the past. It also gave a more uniform  view of the rural  parishes 
and made comparison between parishes easier, since all the pastors and parish 
officials  were asked the same questions. 

The 1582 Visitation turned up other complaints, particularly concerning the 
practice of usury, but also about such vices as swearing, blasphemy, and danc-
ing. Nevertheless, despite these problems the overall impression of church life 
in Basel's rural territories was encouraging. Several pastors  said that they  had 
no  complaints  with  their  congregations,  and  many  reported  that  their 
parishioners  were  diligent  in  attending worship  (although  a few  complained 
that  they  arrived  late  to  worship).  Again,  the  parish  officials  were  generally 
satisfied  with  their  pastors;  their  most  frequent  complaint  was  that  their 
pastor's  sermons were too long.33 

While  the  1572  Visitation  had  concentrated  particularly  on  questions  of 
conduct by both clergy and laity, the visitors in 1582 were also concerned with 
the clergy's doctrinal orthodoxy  and the adequacy of religious Instruction  for 
adults. Pastors  were  admonished  to  teach  according  to the  Basel  Confession 
(the  city's  official  confession  of  faith,  adopted  in  1534) and were warned  not 
to  sign the Formula  of  Concord. They  were  also told  to  read  the sections  of 
the  catechism  from  the pulpit  at the  conclusion  of  the  sermon,  so  that  those 
who  did  not  attend  catechism  Instruction  would  regularly  hear  the  basics of 
their  evangelical  faith. 

In  view  of  the  rarity  with  which  either  synods  or  visitations  were  held,

32  A model Visitation Instruction from  1582 stated that the visitors should question  each pastor 
«auß seinem  Rodeil,»  BUB MsKiAr  22a, Nr.  111, fo. 562r. It  is unclear whether  earlier visi(cid:173)
tors had used lists of questions that were asked of each pastor, but the variety of answers given 
in 1572 suggests that the interrogation was more open-ended. The only topics mentioned  by 
a majority  of pastors in 1572 were frequency  of attending worship and catechism Services and 
the officials'  negligence in enforcing the Senate's mandates. It is quite possible that the pastors 
were  asked  specifically  about  these two issues, but  both  complaints  are so general that  they 
give little  indication  either  of  the  religious  beliefs  of  the laity  or  the  specific  vices that  were 
not being punished. 
In  response, the visitors  recommended  that  Sunday  sermons  be kept  to  one hour, while  the 
weekday  sermon should not last more than half  an  hour.

Controlling  the  Clergy 

Basel's  church  leaders  had  to  rely  on  another  method  to  supervise  the  rural 
pastors: the regulär meetings of district  and  general chapters of the rural  cler(cid:173)
gy. Most  of Basel's rural territory had  belonged  to the rural chapter  of Sisgau 
before  the  Reformation.34  As  part  of  Basel's  Protestant  church  the  general 
chapter  of  Sisgau was  subdivided  into  three  district  chapters  roughly  corre-
sponding  to  the  administrative  districts  (Vogteien)  of  the  territory.35  These 
district  chapters  were  small:  Waidenburg  had  seven  parishes,  Liestal/Mün(cid:173)
chenstein  had  nine, and Farnsburg  had  eleven parishes. As mentioned  above, 
the Senate had appointed  a new dean, Hans Bruwiler, for the entire chapter in 
the  spring  of  1529, but  he  had  proven  unable  or  unwilling  to  carry  out  his 
duties. At  the fall  synod  of  1529, Bruwiler  was reminded  of his  responsibili(cid:173)
ties to  summon  the  clergy to  a general convent,  but  the following  spring  the 
pastors  complained  that  Bruwiler  had  not  called  a meeting  and  asked  that  a 
new dean be appointed.36 At the  1535 synod the pastors asked that they be al-
lowed  to  elect  three  district  deans  to  supervise  the  rural  church,  a  proposal 
which  the Senate  approved, while  reserving the right to  confirm  the  pastors' 
candidates.37 For the next two  decades the three district  deans bore the  brunt 
of  the  supervisory  responsibilities  for  the  rural  parishes, and  the position  of 
«primary  dean»  for  the  entire  Sisgau  chapter  was left  vacant  after  Bruwiler's 
deathinl540.38 

In  1562 the Senate approved new Statutes for the Sisgau chapter  providing 
for the appointment  of a new «primary dean» by the Kirchenrat, a body  com-
prised of the four parish pastors in the city and the three Scholarchs (the Sena(cid:173)
tors responsible for oversight of university and church).39 The Statutes  further 
required  that  each district  chapter  meet twice a year to  discuss issues of  con-
cern and for the purpose of fraternal  admonition. A general convent of all rural

sor to the dean of the entire Sisgau chapter was called the «primarius  decanus» in later  docu-
ments. 

39  According to  an account written  in the  early  1590s, the rural pastors  had twice  opposed  the 
imposition  of a primary  dean  but were eventually forced  by the magistrate  to accept the  au-
thority  of Leonhard  Strübin in  1562; BUB MsKiAr 22a: 249r.

pastors was  to  be held  every  two  years  in  order  to  consider  problems  facing 
the  church;  their  findings  and  suggestions  were  to  be forwarded  to  the  Kir(cid:173)
chenrat.40 The  1562 Statutes thus placed  the chief  responsibility  for  oversight 
of the rural clergy on the primary dean and the three district deans. 

In  1582 these Statutes were revised to strengthen  further  the power  of  the 
deans. The new Statutes specified the disciplinary measures to be taken against 
any  pastor  whose  conduct  or  teaching  needed  correction,  they  clarified  the 
procedures for administering admonition or punishment, and they established 
the method  of appeal for individual pastors. The procedure roughly  followed 
the scriptural model for  church  discipline (Matthew  18:15-17), with  admoni(cid:173)
tion being given in three stages of increasing severity. Pastors who rejected  all 
admonition,  even that of a general chapter, were referred  to the Kirchenrat  in 
the city, but the Kirchenrat would not hear a case unless the dean and his chap(cid:173)
ter  had  first  attempted  to  resolve  the  problem.41  This  procedure  meant  that 
only the most serious problems would be brought to the attention of the secu-
lar and ecclesiastical authorities in the city. 

The trend towards  greater  supervision  of the clergy only accelerated  after 
Johann  Jakob  Grynaeus  became  Antistes  in  1586.  Like  his  predecessors, 
Grynaeus  began his tenure as Antistes with a burst of energy: in the ten years 
after  assuming  office,  he conducted  three visitations, held  one  general  synod 
for  all clergy in Basel and  another  solely for  the urban pastors, and  regularly 
attended  or  sent another  representative  of  the Kirchenrat  to the  general  con-
vents of the rural pastors. The tone of these meetings was much different  from 
that  of the synods  of the  1550s. The earlier synods had reflected  the  solidari-
ty of the clergy vis-ä-vis the magistrate and a sense that they could  recommend 
ecclesiastical policy to the Senate. In the 1580s and 1590s the perception of the 
clergy as an undifferentiated  group was replaced by a sense of hierarchical au-
thority. At its head, Grynaeus was both  the representative  of the  magistrate's 
authority and the conduit through whom the clergy passed its complaints and 
recommendations  on to the Senate.42 The position  of primary  dean had  again 
been left vacant after  the death of its incumbent in 1582, but in 1588 the  office 
was  combined  with  that  of  Antistes,  to  give  Grynaeus  direct  responsibility 
over the rural church. In addition, the district deans were now held more rigor-
ously to  the  requirement  that  they  hold  regulär  chapter  meetings  and  report 
problems  to the  Kirchenrat.43

Controlling the  Clergy 

Grynaeus  himself  believed that the only way to eliminate the last vestiges 
of Lutheran sympathies from  the Basel church was through zealous  oversight 
of its clergy. As a consequence, the censure of the clergy, both in doctrine and 
conduct, took on a new importance in the synods and visitations. The records 
of  both  are much  more  detailed  than  those  held  under  Grynaeus'  predeces-
sors. It  was  no  longer  sufficient  simply  to  note  that  there was  no  complaint 
about a pastor. The synod and Visitation protocols now recorded what text he 
used for his Sunday and weekday sermons, how frequently  he held  catechism 
instruction,  whether  he  willingly  visited  the  sick  and  carried  out  his  other 
pastoral duties, and whether  he accepted  the teachings contained  in the Basel 
Reformation  Ordinance of 1529 and the Basel Confession  of 1534. Despite the 
higher Standards of doctrine and conduct to which the pastors were held, there 
were few complaints made about the Basel clergy in the visitations, synods and 
general chapters. Indeed, most of the pastors seem to have shared their leaders' 
expectations  concerning  doctrine and  conduct. 

The  regulär  meetings  of  both  district  and  general  chapters  also  became 
more  important  as  a means  of  supervising  the  teaching  and  conduct  of  the 
clergy. Again,  supervision  was  assisted  by  improved  documentation:  during 
the 1590s each of the district chapters began to keep records of its sessions, and 
Grynaeus  himself  carefully  wrote  down  the  agenda  and  the  decisions  made 
during  the  weekly  meetings  of  the  Kirchenrat.  The  protocols  of  the  general 
chapters,  synods  and  visitations  were  also  transcribed  in  the  official  record 
book  of the  Kirchenrat.44 

The concern with doctrinal orthodoxy that emerged in the early 1580s only 
increased  over  the  course  of  the  1590s. It  culminated  at a general convent  of 
the  Sisgau  chapter  in March,  1598, which was  called  specifically  for  the  pur-
pose of establishing doctrinal unity  among the rural pastors.45 To ensure doc(cid:173)
trinal  consensus,  the  magistrate  sent  Grynaeus,  his  chief  assistant  Johann 
Tryphius, and theology professor  (and Grynaeus' son-in-law) Amandus Pola(cid:173)
nus to make sure there was no confusion  or ambiguity in the Interpretation of 
the city's official  confession.  At the general convent, the individual articles of 
the Basel Confession  were read aloud and the city theologians explained  their 
«proper»  Interpretation  to the rural pastors. At  the  end, each was asked if he 
agreed  with  the  contents  of  the  Confession  as so  interpreted.  Those  pastors 
suspected  of  inclining  to  Lutheranism  were  asked  particularly  about  their

synods  of  1590, the general chapters  of Aug.  1593 and  Oct.  1595, the general synod  of June, 
1597, and the visitations of 1587,1589,1601. The acts of the district chapters begin for Farns(cid:173)
burg  in  1592, for  Liestal in  1593 and  for  Waidenburg  in  1599. In  each case, a new  dean  was 
chosen for  these chapters the year before  the records begin, and it seems likely that the  new 
deans shared  Grynaeus' view about the importance  of  documentation.

views  on  the  Lord's  Supper.  Two  months  later,  the  Senate  issued  an  edict 
requiring all clergy to sign the new church ministers' ordinance which, among 
other things, prohibited  them from  praising either the papacy or the  Formula 
of  Concord, ordered  them to report any pastor who  «caused disagreement  in 
doctrine,  whether  privately  or  openly,»  to  the  appropriate  authorities,  and 
required  them to pledge their  loyalty  «to the Christian  lordship  of  Basel, the 
ministry in the city and the dean in the rural territory.»46 

As had happened under both Myconius  and Sulzer, visitations  and  synods 
disappeared  during  the  latter  half  of  Grynaeus'  tenure. There  were  no  more 
visitations  or  general  synods  held  during  Grynaeus'  lifetime,  and  the  church 
records contain only a few references  to general convents  of the rural clergy.47 
Their disappearance was perhaps the result of their success: the close supervi-
sion  over  the  clergy  exercised via the  synods, visitations  and  general  chapter 
meetings of the 1580s and 1590s had eliminated doctrinal divisions and set clear 
Standards f or clerical behavior, while the elaboration of a hierarchical disciplin-
ary structure and the increasingly detailed documentation  at the level of  both 
district chapter and  Kirchenrat  made it easier to oversee individual pastors. 

Once  the hierarchical  structure  had  been  established, the magistrate  itself 
saw  little  need  for  spending  money  on  a general  Visitation.  The  Senate  was 
acutely  aware  of  the  costs  incurred  by  the  visitations,  particularly  by  the 
common  meal for  all participants  held  at the  close of  each day's  Session, and 
even  when  the  Visitation  was  seen  as  necessary,  it  counted  its  pennies.  The 
Senate's  concern  about  costs was evident during the Visitation of April, 1594, 
held  at a time when  the  inhabitants  of  the  rural  territories  were  dangerously 
close  to  rebellion  as the  result  of  the  imposition  of  a new  tax  (the  so-called 
«Rappenkrieg»).48 The Visitation enabled the Senate's representative,  Andreas 
von  Speyr, to  ascertain  the  loyalty  of  peasants  and  local  officials  in the  rural 
districts, but in his report back to the Senate von  Speyr was apologetic  about 
the expense, justifying  it by stating that since two recently-appointed  pastors 
had been officially  installed in their positions as part of the Visitation, they had 
saved the cost of  a separate Ordination Service.49

In  1605 Grynaeus  had  each rural pastor  submit  in writing  a Status report  for  his parish,  but 
these reports  differed  widely in the amount  of detail each pastor provided. Thirteen  of these 
reports  are  preserved  in  BUB,  most  of  them  in  the  volumes  of  Grynaeus'  correspondence 
(G  II  5-12).

Controlling  the  Clergy 

The  Senate  also  saw  little  need  for  a  general  synod.  Because  it  brought 
together all clergy in city and rural territory, the general synod had at least the 
appearance  of  being  a more  «democratic»  assembly,  able to present  a united 
front to the Senate when submitting its grievances. The Senate preferred to rely 
on the hierarchical structure  established  by the Statutes of the Sisgau  chapter, 
which subordinated each pastor to his district dean, each district chapter to the 
general chapter,  and  the  entire rural  church  to the  Kirchenrat. Moreover,  the 
magistrate  saw  major  events  such  as  a general  synod  or  Visitation  as  «extra-
ordinary»  and  unnecessary  for  the  normal  running  of  the  church.50 The  city 
pastors may not have agreed with the Senate's assessment, but they had no au-
thority to call either a Visitation or a synod  on their  own. 

From the very beginning the pastors  had  opposed  making the public  cen-
sure of the clergy a central part of the synods and visitations. The chapter Stat(cid:173)
utes  of  1582  acknowledged  that  the  censure  had  in  the  past  «caused  gross 
mistakes, discord,  envy  and hatred  among many  brothers  but  brought  about 
few improvements.»51 The hierarchical structure of the rural church  benefited 
the rural clergy to the extent that it removed  the process of  clerical  discipline 
from  the  public  eye. The  rural  deans  had  the  authority  to  intervene  before 
potential  problems  became  serious  enough  that  they  had  to  be dealt with  in 
public  at the  synods  or visitations  and  hence  brought  to  the  attention  of  the 
magistrate. The effectiveness  of the admonitory process is indirectly  revealed 
by  occasional  comments  such  as  that  made  by  the  Waidenburg  dean  Jakob 
Gugger  during  the  1601 Visitation,  that  problems  among  the  pastors  in  his 
district «had been resolved, according to the Contents of the Statutes, at a special 
meeting and should not be revealed again in the general convent or Visitation.»52 
In  summary,  although  synods  and  visitations  were  an important  compo-
nent  of  clerical  oversight  in Basel, they were  not  held  regularly  enough  after 
1540 to provide  continual  close supervision  of  the rural  clergy. More  signifi-
cant for  overseeing the rural church was the elaboration, over the last third of 
the  Century, of  a hierarchical  structure  that  gave the  district  deans  authority 
over the pastors in their chapters  and made each dean accountable to the An-
tistes and  Kirchenrat  in the  city. Grynaeus'  contribution  was to  make use of 
synods, visitations  and  general  chapters  to  enforce  doctrinal  uniformity  and 
to  see that  the  central  link in  the  hierarchy,  the  district  deans, were  carrying 

Cf.  the meeting of March 9,1593  in the Kirchenratsprotokolle,  BStA Kirchen Archiv D  1,1, 
in which Grynaeus reported to the city pastors the Senate's response when asked why it didn't 
call a synod  or Visitation for  the rural churches. He was told  «quod  omnia mediocria  esse in 
urbanis  et provincialibus  Ecclesiis videantur, non  existimare necessariam  esse.»

out their responsibilities  both  towards the pastors under them  and towards  the 
ecclesiastical  authorities  above them. Where  Bullinger  laid the foundations  for 
clerical  discipline  in Zürich,  Grynaeus  put  the  finishing  touches  on  the  struc-
tures  introduced  by  his predecessors  in  Basel.
