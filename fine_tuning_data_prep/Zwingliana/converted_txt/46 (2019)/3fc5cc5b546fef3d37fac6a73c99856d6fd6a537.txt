Portrait of Bullinger’s Theology

Joe Mock

Hans Asper’s portrait of Heinrich Bullinger (dated 1559) which is
kept in the Zentralbibliothek Zürich, shows some striking simila-
rities with Elias Haussmann’s famous portrait (1746) of the com-
poser J. S. Bach. Haussmann’s portrait shows Bach aged 51 years
holding the score of a canon he had composed. The ingenuity of
the manuscript of the canon in Bach’s right hand is that it can be
read musically right way up as well as upside down, thus pointing
to the creative genius of Bach. It is as if Bach is challenging the
viewer to “decode” the music manuscript. Asper’s portrait is of
Bullinger aged 55 holding an open book revealing certain Scripture
passages. It is almost certain that Bullinger intended these verses to
stimulate those who look closely at the portrait to think about how
he understood redemptive history and the message of the Bible as a
whole. Through the portrait Bullinger seeks to challenge the viewer
to grasp the significance of the biblical texts chosen and the order
in which they are presented.

In order, the verses shown are: Matthew 17:5, Colossians
1:19–20, Colossians 2:3, Colossians 2:10, Colossians 2:9, and
John 1:16–17.1 The texts used were from the Zurich Bible of 1539.
Could it be that Bullinger intends us to see two inclusios here?
That is, Matthew 17:5 and John 1:16–17 indicate an overall in-
clusio while Colossians 1:19–20 and Colossians 2:9 indicate an
inner inclusio. On this analysis the outer inclusio undergirds the
role in salvation history of Christ, the eternal Son of God, the

second person of the Trinity. This suggested analysis also explains
why Colossians 2:10 is listed before Colossians 2:9 as the inner
inclusio framed by emphasis on the fullness in Christ focuses on
the believer being complete or perfect because of possessing all in
Christ.

Asper’s portrait has this inscription at the top:

HEINRYCHUS BULLINGERUS
UNDECIMI IAM NUNC LABUNTUR SYDERA LUSTRI
HAEC AETAS, FORMAM PICTA TABELLA REFERT
NIL EGO VEL FORMAM VEL VITAE TEMPORA SPECTRO
SED CHRISTUM, VITAE QUI MIHI FORMA MEAE EST2

In many ways this inscription is a personal testimony of Bullinger
indicating to what extent Christ has been formed in him in the
context of what it means to live a life that is complete in Christ.
Being fifty five years old Bullinger was well above the average life
expectancy in Europe in the 16th Century.3 The year of the portrait
was also when Bullinger wrote his catechism, Catechesis pro adul-
tioribus scripta and his Sendschrift to Hungary which, in embryo,
contained the essence of The Second Helvetic Confession. This
article examines one by one the Scriptural passages Bullinger chose
for his portrait to reveal how they represent a distilled summary of
Bullinger’s theology. The passages chosen by Bullinger indicate
that he was more concerned for historia salutis rather than ordo
salutis.

1. Matthew 17:5: Hic est filius meus dilectus, in

quo placata est anima mea. Ipsum audite.

It is not surprising that Matthew 17:5 is the first passage in Bul-
linger’s catena of biblical passages. Bullinger’s version of this verse
with placata instead of placitus for eudoke¯sa occurs on the title
page of all of his works.4 Significantly it is repeated on the last

page of his magnum opus, The Decades. Indeed, the verse is given
prominence in sermon IV.1 of The Decades where Bullinger dis-
cusses the gospel in a section where he also refers to 2 Peter 1:17.5
This verse encapsulates for Bullinger both orthodoxy and or-
thopraxis. There is, on the one hand, focus on Jesus, the eternal
Son of God the Father, as the goal of redemptive history, and
emphasis, on the other hand, on disciples of Jesus living righteous
or integer before God. That Bullinger understood this injunction to
be directed to the elect people of God, spiritual Israel or faithful
believers can be seen in Bullinger’s citation of Jeremiah 7:23 in De
testamento, his treatise on the covenant (1534): “Obey my voice
and I will be your God and you will be my people and walk in all
the ways which I have commanded you so that it might be well
with you.”6 Moreover, this quotation from Jeremiah 7:23 is jux-
taposed with the explanation that the summary of the covenant is
obedience or faith.7

The context of Matthew 17:5 in Matthew’s Gospel is the trans-
figuration of Christ together with Moses and Elijah. This under-
scored for Bullinger that Christ not only fulfilled the Law and the
Prophets but that he was also the climax of biblical revelation. As
Bullinger constantly emphasized the message of the biblical canon
as a whole, this verse, for him, pointed to Christ as the goal of the
canon. Since Bullinger viewed redemptive history as being unfold-
ed with the progressive revealing of God’s covenant with his elect
people it is also the case that this verse points to Christ as the goal
or focus of the covenant.8 In this connection, Peter Opitz has iden-
tified in Bullinger’s use of this verse a reference to both the priestly
and rabbinic roles of Christ who, as Redeemer, fulfills the cove-

nant.9 In fact, Bullinger had made this point as early as 1525 in
Von dem Touff: “dass ouch Christus sye unser volcökomne, welchs
nütz abders ist, dann dass in Christo, der vater versönt und das
testament erfüllt worden ist [Kol 1, 19f].”10

For Bullinger, the goal of redemptive history is about reconcili-
ation: the reconciliation of mankind to God and the reconciliation
of God to mankind. With respect to Matthew 17:5 Christine
Christ-von Wedel observed that “Erasmus’s translation allows for
the interpretation that God is reconciled with humans (Luke 2:14)
through his beloved Son (Matthew 17:5), an interpretation which
was already favoured by the Zurich Reformers”.11 This is reflected
in Bullinger’s use of placata rather than placita. It is not without
significance that in sermon IV.1 of The Decades in which Bullinger
unpacks his understanding of the gospel he uses placatus rather
than placitus as many as six times.12 Bullinger stated that: “The
heavenly Father truly set forth his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ for
our propitiation, certainly to be our reconciliation, on account of
God being reconciled (placatus) we might be adopted into the
(number of the) sons of God.”13 He further pointed out that:
“However many believe in Christ, assuredly because of him, the
Father is reconciled (placatus) to us and because of him we are
considered to be just (iusti) and holy (sancti).”14

The significance of in quo is determinative for Bullinger’s un-
derstanding of reconciliation. Reconciliation with God is only pos-
sible for believers if they are in Christ. Bullinger’s point is that the
believer is “in Christ” or in union with Christ and, therefore, re-
ceives omnia bona in him. Indeed, union with Christ undergirded
Bullinger’s understanding of the gospel and, therefore, not surpri-
singly, this theme is reflected in many of his works. For example,
he deliberately referred to union with Christ in several sections of

the Consensus Tigurinus (1549).15 Moreover, chapters XV (justi-
fication) and XX (baptism) of The Second Helvetic Confession
refer respectively to participating in Christ by believing and being
joined to God himself by a holy covenant. Union with Christ is
also clearly stated in the title given to the sermon in which he
unpacks his understanding of the gospel, viz. sermon IV.1 of The
Decades (in hoc verae salutis omnia).16 Thus Opitz observes that
Bullinger’s understanding of Matthew 17:5 “characterizes also his
exegesis of Romans. But listening to Christ means having faith in
Christ which is possible only in pneumatical union with Christ,
that is, participation in Christ’s spirit of love”.17

Matthew 17:5 also contains, for Bullinger, a strong parenetic
emphasis in ipsum audite. Bullinger understood audite in terms of
obedience as is evident from his translation into German: “imm
sind gehörig.” In doing so, Bullinger was effectively explaining that
the torah of the old covenant was replaced by the torah, teaching
or instruction of the Messiah in the new covenant that would be
written on the hearts of men and women in fulfillment of Jeremiah
31. Thus, Bullinger indicated both the discontinuity and continuity
between the old covenant and the new covenant. Just as God’s
chosen people in the old covenant were called to live covenant
faithful lives by living according to torah so the elect people of
God in the new covenant are called to live according to the word
of Christ. It is clear from Bullinger’s commentary on Matthew that
he saw in Matthew 17:5 a direct reference to the prophet to come
who is mentioned in Deuteronomy 18:15.18 This is clearly referred
to in Chapter XIII (the gospel of Jesus Christ) of The Second Hel-

vetic Confession. In terms of redemption history, Bullinger saw the
transfiguration of Christ in Matthew 17 as the dawning of the
“age to come”. This is reflected in Joseph Ratzinger’s observation
that “The Torah of the Messiah is the Messiah, Jesus himself. It is
to him that the command ‘Listen to him’ refers”.19

Elsewhere in his works Bullinger referred to solus Christus au-
diendus. With respect to this phrase, Danie¨l Timmerman has poin-
ted out that the “motto from Cyprian was first transmitted to
Bullinger through the writings of Erasmus”.20 Bullinger first refer-
red to solus Christus audiendus as early as 1523 in his De scrip-
turae negotio.21 Bullinger subsequently reiterated solus Christus
audiendus in Antwort an Burchard (1526).22 Staedtke has descri-
bed solus Christus audiendus as Bullinger’s “dominant theme of
putting into practice theological knowledge”.23

Staedtke’s observation of Bullinger’s understanding of ipsum au-
dite in terms of solus Christus audiendus explains why Matthew
17:5 is so foundational to Bullinger’s theology. For Bullinger, in
this verse is encapsulated soteriology in the context of redemptive
history juxtaposed with an exhortation for living integer. Because
the covenant was the means for enacting God’s plan for the sal-
vation of his people as well the context for living integer Bullinger
concluded his treatise on the covenant, De testamento (1534), with
his own translation of Psalm 25:10:

“Omnes viae domini sunt gratia & fides
His qui servant testamentum & foedus eius.”

2. Colossians 1:19–20: Quoniam complacuit patri
universam in quo inhabitare plenitudinem, et per

eum reconciliare cuncta sibi, pacificatis per sanguine
crucis eius per eundem, sive quae in terra sunt, quae

in coelis.24

Several observations can be made of the text used. Firstly, the
addition of patri was due to an ellipsis in the Greek text. The
addition of patri rather than Deo points to a parallel with Mat-
thew 17:5 with a focus on the Father-Son relationship between
God cornucopia “the horn of plenty” and Christ. Secondly, the
translation of pan with universam rather than the Vulgate’s om-
nem is to be noted. Although omnis does mean “all”, universus
refers to “entire” or “whole” and, therefore, the choice of this
adjective underscores that there is not the slightest hint of subor-
dination between the Son and the Father. Thirdly, ta panta is
translated with cuncta rather than omnia which is used by the
Vulgate.25 In The Decades Bullinger often used cunctus rather than
omnis to differentiate in a subtle manner between “all” according
to God’s plan and “all” without exception.26 In many ways these
verses allude to a theme that underlies Bullinger’s works viz. that
the biblical canon is the revelation of God’s redemptive plan from
the Garden of Eden to the new Garden of the Book of Revelation.
Unmistakably, Bullinger chose these key verses from Colossians
to underscore the full divinity of Christ and, thereby, to present
him on a par with God cornucopia. InDe testamento Bullinger
referred to God specifically as El Shaddai who, in confirming and
establishing the covenant with Abraham and his descendants, in-
troduced himself as “I am the abundantly all-sufficient God, the

24 In Bullinger’s commentary on Colossians he has “Quoniam in illo complacitum
est patri universam plenitudinem inhabitare et per eum reconciliare cuncta erga se,
pacificatis per sanguine crucis eius per eundem, sive quae in terra sunt sive in coelis”.

horn of plenty”.27 The significance of these two verses from Co-
lossians for Bullinger, therefore, is that they serve to highlight that
those who are in Christ receive all the covenant blessings God
promises to his elect. The fact that this passage underscores the
“blood of the cross” indicates, for Bullinger, that the blessings of
the covenant are given by God cornucopia through the means of
the blood of the covenant as the seal of God’s one and everlasting
covenant. Moreover, this passage highlights reconciliation which is
at the centre of Matthew 17:5.

Colossians 1:19 is cited by Bullinger at the end of sermon I.8 of
The Decades in a section dealing with the Apostle’s Creed and
specifically in his discussion of the Holy Spirit. His version of this
verse here is somewhat nuanced: “‘It pleased the Father,’ said the
apostle, ‘that the whole fullness should dwell in the Son’ (Colos-
sians 1:19) and in him to recapitulate (recapitulare) and, as it were,
bring all aspects of salvation into a sum that in him the faithful
might be made perfect”.28 There is thus a deliberate link made with
Ephesians 1:10 and with Colossians 2:10 where Bullinger trans-
lated the Greek text by et estis in illo completi.29 Significantly, in
De testamento Bullinger referred to the one and eternal covenant
of God in terms of “recapitulation”.30 Evidently, Bullinger was
following Irenaeus in employing the classical rhetoric recapitulans
to refer to the life and ministry of Christ in that Christ not only
“repeats” the history of mankind but that he is also the summary
statement of the Father.31

tamento, 12r.

3. Colossians 2:3 In quo enim sunt reconditi omnes

thesauri sapientiae ac scientiae

How Bullinger understood the theological significance of this verse
must be seen in the context of how he viewed the words of the
preceding verse. The text of this verse that Bullinger used in his
commentary on Colossians is also the same as that in the Zurich
Bible of 1539 viz. in agitionem mysterii dei et patris et Christi.32
There is a clear difference with the text in the Vulgate, in agitionem
mysterii Dei Patris Christi Iesu, where “Christ” is in apposition
with “the mystery of God the Father”. It appears that Bullinger
exegeted Colossians 2:2 in terms of Paul’s desire that the Colos-
sians might know the mystery of God, viz. of both the Father and
Christ. Bullinger naturally understood “mystery” as that which
was previously “hidden” but now “revealed”. In De testamento
Bullinger had underscored that the greatest covenant gift was that
of God El Shaddai (cornucopia) who gives himself to his chosen
covenant people. In redemption history, this became a reality in
the age of the new covenant with Christ in the heart of the believer
through the Holy Spirit. Hence, Bullinger has chosen in Colossians
2:3 to use the verb recondo rather than abscondo which is used
both by the Vulgate and by Calvin in his commentary. Reconditi
refers to something that has been stored away whereas absconditi
refers to something that is concealed. Bullinger sought, therefore,
to see a nuanced difference between something that had been sto-
red away (and, therefore, “hidden” or “out of sight”) to be re-
vealed at the planned time and something that had been “hidden”
and then, subsequently, “revealed”.

Colossians 2:3, 9, 10 are linked together towards the end of
Bullinger’s discussion of true faith in sermon I.4 of The Decades
where he refers to ingentia haec beneficia dei gratis conferantur
fidelibus.33 This sermon spotlights the meaning of the gospel and
concludes with a declaration that the heart of the gospel is the
fullness and sufficiency of Christ, that is to say, solus Christus.

4. Colossians 2:10 – Et estis in illo completi

The Vulgate has a slightly different text, viz. et estis in illo repleti.
Bullinger may be seeing here a subtle difference between “perfect”
(completi) and “full” (repleti). Thus this verse may well encapsu-
late for Bullinger one of the goals of the incarnation. Certainly the
incarnation is underlined in Colossians 2:9 which is the next text
in this catena of Bible texts. Significantly, Colossians 2 is referred
to by Bullinger in his commentary on 2 Peter 1:3, 4 where the
apostle Peter asserts ut per haec efficeremini divinae consortes na-
turae. For Bullinger, therefore, being completus in Christ as one of
the benefits of the incarnation is more than being thoroughly
equipped and enabled to live integer in covenant relationship with
God. It is also, somehow, to share in God’s divine nature as the
believer is in Christ.

In Bullinger’s explanation of the theological import of John
1:14–18 in his commentary of John he highlights the significance
of the incarnation of Christ for believers with a direct reference to
chapters 1 and 2 of Colossians. Citing Chrysostom, Bullinger sta-
ted of Christ that ipse fons est et radix bonorum omnium34 and
that believers receive the incarnate word ceu omnium bonarum
iugi fonte, gratiarum.35 In Christ, therefore, the believer receives all
the promised covenant promises and blessings of God. This is suc-
cinctly declared in his commentary on John as in quo perfecte
consummantur credentes.36 Every word in this statement has been
carefully chosen by Bullinger as it points to the purpose of the
creation of mankind in terms of redemption history with believers37
in Christ being made perfectly complete in Christ. Having stated
that Christ is the font of living water Bullinger also pointed out in
his commentary on John that in quo proposuit donavitque nobis
pater omnia ea quae ad perfectam beatitudinem sunt necessaria.38
In the same commentary he further pointed out that, in his son,

39

God gives believers incomparabilis thesaurus and omnes caelestes
thesaurus.39

For the believer to be in illo or in Christo is only possible
through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Scholars have rightly
observed that Bullinger rarely makes direct reference to the role of
the Holy Spirit but rather indirect inferences to the Spirit’s work in
the life of the elect. Bullinger often emphasized that it is through
the Holy Spirit that the Torah of Christ is inscribed on the hearts
of God’s elect in the new covenant (Jeremiah 31, Ezekiel 36). As
indicated above, Opitz explained that listening to Christ (Ipsum
audite) “is possible only in pneumatical union with Christ”.

5. Colossians 2:9 – Quoniam in illo inhabit omnis

plenitudo Dei corporaliter

In Bullinger’s commentary for this verse he has deitatis instead of
Dei which is the case for the Zurich Bible of 1539 and the Vulgate.
This is merely Bullinger’s effort to more accurately translate theo-
te¯tos. In his commentary on this verse Bullinger underlines that
this explains why only Christ is preached, for only through Christ
is the believer made complete and justified. Furthermore, Bullinger
pointed out that “bodily” (corporaliter) also has the sense of “by
nature” (naturaliter). He explained this in terms of er ists lyb-
hafft.40

Bullinger has a comprehensive discussion of the two natures of
Christ as a result of the incarnation in sermon IV.6 of The Deca-
des. This needs to be viewed in conjunction with what Bullinger
wrote about the descendit ad inferos clause in the Creed and his
conviction, like Zwingli, of the immortality of the soul. For Bul-
linger the incarnation of Christ was not only for the revelation of
God and for the salvation of sinful mankind but was also funda-
mental for God’s eternal purpose in the creation of mankind in his
image.

6. John 1:16,17 – Et de plenitudine eius nos omnes
accepimus et gratiam pro gratia quia lex per Mosen

data est gratia et veritas per Iesum Christum

exorta est.

These were significant verses for Bullinger as they indicate both the
continuity and discontinuity between the Old Testament and the
New Testament. Significantly, Bullinger asserted that the old co-
venant and the new covenant had the same religio vera and the
same substantia.41 But they do differ in terms of their “acci-
dents”.42 Both testaments are characterized by God’s grace. Both
testaments are characterized by lex not understood forensically but
in terms of God’s word or God’s instruction for living integer be-
fore him in a covenant relationship. Bullinger was fond of referring
to the difference between the new covenant and the old covenant
in terms of plenius, clarior, abundantissimus, excellentissimus, per-
fectissimus, splendidissimus and dilucidius.

In explaining the significance of the giving of gratia et veritas per
Iesum Christum in his commentary on John, Bullinger pointed out
the full benefits of the believer in Christ in the new covenant be-
cause in quo sint omnes thesauri caelestium donorum, adeoque
fontem esse perennem gariae, in quo sit quod omnibus sufficiat ad
salutem.43 In the discussion of these verses in his commentary on
John he underscored that the coming of Christ fulfilled what was
written in the Law and the Prophets in terms of promise and ful-
fillment. Therefore, what Christ gives believers is referred to as
superior (praestitia).44

7. Conclusion

This catena of biblical passages was carefully selected and arran-
ged by Bullinger by the means of two inclusios. That these verses
may not be so prominent in the works of Bullinger is not neces-

sarily surprising. Each of the works that Bullinger penned was
addressed to a particular audience or written in a specific context.
There is, however, a deliberate linking of John 1 and Colossians 1
and 2 in the Compendium christianae religionis which is a Latin
version of the Summa christenlicher religion both of which, as
summaries of Christian doctrine, were published in 1556 or three
years before Asper’s portrait.45 The section occurs in Chapter IIII
of Book V of the Compendium christianae religionis which dis-
cusses that all are made perfect in Christ, that the law is fulfilled in
him and that we are justified in him.46 Significantly Bullinger tied
together in this section John 1 and Colossians 1 and 2 with John
3:16 with the emphasis that God gives the elect into the hand of
Jesus and that the elect believe in Jesus and receive eternal life.
Moreover, John 1:17 is coupled together with Colossians 2 in
Chapter XIII of The Second Helvetic Confession which is a suc-
cinct summary of the gospel. Indeed, this section of The Second
Helvetic Confession states that what is rightly called the gospel is
about those who have fullness through believing in Jesus and that
evangelical doctrine is that in Jesus is to be found everything for
salvation.47

It appears, therefore, that Bullinger chose these biblical passages
to summarize his understanding of the gospel in the context of
redemptive history. The passages chosen point to an unmistakable
emphasis on fulfillment which is also reflected in the The Second
Helvetic Confession:

“Therefore, the history delineated by the four Evangelists and explaining
how these things were done or fulfilled by Christ, what Christ taught and
did and that those who believe in him have all fullness, is rightly called the
gospel.”48

As Christian Moser has pointed out, whenever Bullinger refers to
history what is on view is primarily redemptive history and history
of the covenant.49 Bullinger constantly focused on Versöhnungs-
geschichte and Bundesgeschichte. Hence, the history of the cove-
nant is prominent in Bullinger’s works because, in terms of pro-
mise and fulfillment, it explains how God accomplished his goal
and purpose for redemptive history. This is succinctly expressed in
Chapter XIII of The Second Helvetic Confession where Bullinger
explained that the gospel is preached in that:

“God has now performed what he promised from the beginning of the
world, and has sent, nay more, has given us his only Son and him recon-
ciliation with the Father, the remission of sins, all fullness and everlasting
life.”50

After careful examination, the key theological themes of reconci-
liation, forgiveness of sins, fullness in Christ and eternal life are
either directly stated or implied in the biblical passages in the por-
trait of Bullinger. Thus, in redemptive historical terms, for Bullin-
ger the gospel is about salvation fully accomplished in and through
Christ.51 The Scripture passages in Asper’s portrait, therefore, in-
dicate Bullinger’s unswerving emphasis on Christ’s role in redemp-
tive history to save the elect viz. those who believe in him. This is
the heart of the faith that Bullinger sought to teach others. This is
reflected in the extensive study of The Decades by Opitz who con-
cluded that one unmistakable theme of this work of Bullinger that
was addressed to lay people is “Christus als Skopus der Trinitäts-
lehre und Zentrum der regula fidei”.52

whole. In particular, there is focus on Bullinger’s christology, viz. the deity and hu-
manity of Christ in the context of the three persons of the economic Trinity working in
unison. The elect are in Christ and, thereby, receive all the covenant promises and
blessings of God.
