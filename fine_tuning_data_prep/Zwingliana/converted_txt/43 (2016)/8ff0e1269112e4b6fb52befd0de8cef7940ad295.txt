A variant copy of Konrad Gessner’s

“Bibliotheca Universalis” 1

Koichi Yukishima

Konrad Gessner (1516–1565) was among the most eminent hu-
manists and naturalists in Switzerland in the 16th century. When he
was 29 years old, he began to publish a series of bibliographies
including the Bibliotheca Universalis, Pandectarum, Partitiones
theologicae, and Appendix printed by Christoph Froschauer in
Zurich. The series’ first volume, Bibliotheca Universalis (Zurich:
Christoph Froschauer, 1545), is especially considered as among his
masterpieces and the great classics in the fields of bibliography and
of library and information science. For his work on the Bibliotheca
Universalis, Gessner is regarded by many as “the Father of Biblio-
graphy”2.

Although many scholars have researched and referred to the Bi-
bliotheca Universalis since the first half of the 20th century, atten-
tion has not been given to its variant state or cancellation. In this
regard, the author found two variant copies among the 10 copies
available to the author, which include five copies in Japan, a copy
annotated by Gessner himself, three copies in the Zurich Central
Library, and another copy in Basel University Library. This paper
presents a report on the copy of the Bibliotheca Universalis that
has not been identified as a variant, with a focus on this copy’s

variant typesetting. In the field of bibliography, this study offers
the significant contribution of clarifying what happened in the time
of printing the Bibliotheca Universalis.

In the course of examing all of the available copies of the Biblio-
theca Universalis to identify the variant copies, the five copies
housed at the following libraries in Japan (call No. & provenance)
were accessed first:

1 Hiroshima University of Economics Library, Hiroshima (026, Georg Sa-

binus’s copy)

2 Keio University Library, Tokyo (141X@40@1)
3 National Diet Library, Tokyo (WA 42–27)
4 Meiji University Library, Tokyo (091.3/970//H, a copy of the Society of

Writers to the Signet, Edinburgh)

5 Waseda University Library, Tokyo (F026–36, a copy of Tegernsee Abbey,

Bavaria, and then Jeno˝ Pa´szte´lyi’s copy)

The Waseda copy had been housed at Tegernsee Abbey in Bavaria,
from the 16th to the 18th centuries. The manuscript notes on the
flyleaf indicated that the library had kept its copy even after the
Tridentine index of the Roman Catholic Church in 1564. The ab-

bey regarded the Bibliotheca Universalis highly as it contained
many records of Catholic authors together with Protestant ones.

At one point, the notes indicated that the scribe criticized Gess-
ner for being deeply silent on Erasmus of Rotterdam as he could
not find any item of the Dutch humanist in the book. Another
reader of the Bibliotheca Universalis later noted “vidi Desider.” on
the manuscript notes’ left margin and drew a slanted line over lines
11–15 of the notes. The latter reader pointed out that this note was
necessary to aid the search for the item “Desiderius Erasmus”. The
notes show how the Bibliotheca Universalis remained in use at the
monastery in Southern Germany in the Counter Reformation5 pe-
riod despite being banned by the Roman Catholic Church.

At the time of the secularization in 1803,6 most books and ma-
nuscripts housed at the abbey were sent to the Royal Library in
Munich. However, this copy was not added to the collection of the
Royal Library but was later owned by a Hungarian collector, Dr.
Jeno˝ Pa´szte´lyi (1850–1918).

The typesetting of the other four copies of the Bibliotheca Univer-
salis in Japan are the same as that in the Waseda’s. Any variant
copy is unknown in Japan.

Subsequently, the author examined five other copies in the fol-

lowing libraries in Switzerland from 2013 to 2015:

1 Zurich Central Library (Dr M 3, Konrad Gessner’s own copy, onwards

Copy A)

2 Zurich Central Library (IV O 2, Konrad Pellikan’s copy, onwards Copy

B)

3 Zurich Central Library (IV O 4 & IV O 5, bound in 2, a copy of ‘Ia-
cobus Silvius Ambianus In Medicina’ [= Jacques Dubois], onwards Copy

copy)

Gessner’s own copy of the Bibliotheca Universalis

in Zurich Central Library (Copy A)

Copy A is the most important and interesting copy bibliographi-
cally among these five copies as Gessner himself wrote many of the
manuscript notes regards corrections, revisions, and deletions in
the text as well as rearrangements and additions of items throug-
hout the book; this copy also probably retains the original paper
size (350×215mm). Gessner added other pieces of publication in-
formation in Copy A until the early 1550s.7 Extremely remarkable
deletions are shown in the latter part of the item by Gessner him-
self in fol. 180v where he drew inclined lattice lines over the text
and vertical lines for erasing several manuscripts notes on the left
outer margin (see Figure 3). However, any variant typesetting of
fol. 180v has been unknown.

Moreover, Gessner crossed out lines 4–30 of fol. 454v in the
latter half of the item of “IOANNES filius Serapionis” in the fol-
lowing manner:8

The comparison of above sentences between Copies A and B
shows that Gessner reduced lines 4–30 of Copy A to lines 4–14 of
Copy B with three additional sentences (lines 7, 9–10 and 13–14
underlined in Copy B’s citation). He also added new sentences
located in lines 15–32 including an explanation on Ioannes filius
Serapionis (Ibn Sara¯bı¯) being different from Ioannes Serapion
(Yah
ya¯ b. Sara¯fyu¯ n). When creating new sentences, Gessner refer-
˙
red to Giglio Giraldi’s Dialogus V (i.e., Historiae poetarum tam
Graecorum quam Latiorum dialogi decem) as mentioned to Io-
hannes Damascenus (see lines 26–27 of Copy B). He used the Basel
edition of Giraldi’s Dialogus published in 1545, which is listed in
the preface of the Bibliotheca Universalis (*6v) as among his im-
portant resources for Greek poets.

As such, the comparison between the two copies clearly shows
that fol. 454v was reprinted. Gessner immediately corrected lines
4–30 upon seeing the printed fol. 454v of Copy A and created new
sentences for lines 4–32; printer, Christoph Froschauer, printed
another copy. Moreover, fol. 454v was spliced into two sheets of
slips, and Gessner pasted them each on the lower margins of fol.
454v and fol. 455r of Copy A.

The increase by two lines (the 31st and 32nd lines) of fol. 454v in
Copy B compelled the printer to omit two lines from the next two
items, “IOAN. Sermoneta medicus” and “IOAN. Serranus”. The
printer reduced four lines (the 34th from the 31st line) from the first
item “IOAN. Sermoneta medicus” of Copy A to three lines (the
35th from the 33rd line) of Copy B without changing sentences (see
Figure 6). Three lines (the 37th from the 35th line) of the latter item
“IOAN. Serranus” of Copy A were decreased to two lines (the
37th from the 36th line) of Copy B in the same way. In short, Fro-
schauer adjusted the sentences with seven lines in Copy A to the
sentences with five lines in Copy B in the following composition
skill:

Although any variant of typesetting or cancellation in the Biblio-
theca Universalis have never been reported,
the aforesaid
differences between Copies A and B indicate that the outer
(2g3r/2g4v) and inner (2g3v/2g4r) formes of fol. 453–454 of Copy
A were completely changed to the formes of Copy B. This means
that Copy B is bibliographically an ideal copy, whereas, Copy A is
a variant one. A bibliographer, Fredson Bowers, defines ‘ideal co-
py’ as “a book which is complete in all its leaves as it ultimately

left the printer’s shop on perfect condition and in the complete
state that he considered to represent the final and most perfect
state of the book”12. He also defines the term ‘variant state’ as
“alterations of all varieties made during the printing and before
copies are placed on public sale”13, and then presents the following
five major classes of variant state14:

1. Alterations which do not affect the makeup and which were made in the
type-pages of a forme, whether intentionally or unintentionally, while it
was printing.

2. The addition, substitution, or deletion of any matter which affects the
makeup but which was done in the course of ‘continuous printing’ and
before public sale.

3. Alterations to the text or to any other part of the book which are made
for the purpose of correcting or perfecting the edition but which are not
accompanied by substitution of a different title-page and thus cannot be
regarded as actually constituting a re-issue of the original sheets of the
book, even though public sale had begun.

4. Errors and ‘corrections’ made in imposing, machining, or binding the

sheets.

5. Large-paper or fine-paper copies machined without removing the forms
from the press after ordinary printing except for washing, normal press-
correction, or adjustment of margins.

Copy B is an ideal copy for Gessner and Froschauer and Copy A
corresponds to the third class of variant state. The fol. 453–454 of
the other two copies of the Zurich Central Library (Copies C and
D) show that Copy C is a variant similar with Copy A. Meanwhile,
Copy D, the Basel copy and the five copies in Japan are ideal ones
similar with Copy B.

The variant copy occurred as a result of the printer changing the
formes of fol. 453–454 based on Gessner’s corrections. From the
viewpoint of bibliographical cancellation, a bifolium (a sheet of
paper folded in two to make two leaves) of fol. 453–454 of Copy
A is cancellanda (the plural of cancellandum), and that of fol.
453–454 of Copy B is cancellantia (the plural of cancellans).15 The-

theca Universalis as follows:

2h–2z6 AA–MM6 NN8

Although Gessner, indeed, wrote many simple corrections and ad-
ditions throughout Copy A, Froschauer never revised the text. Af-
ter completing the quire 2g, however, Froschauer accepted Gess-
ner’s own revision in fol. 454v (2g4), printed the aforesaid can-
cellantia, and then replaced them in the quire 2g. These facts have
clarified a part of the printing process of the Bibliotheca Univer-
salis. The reasons why Froschauer did not proofread simple errors
but accepted only the complicated cancellation as well as why
Gessner revised the latter part of the item of “IOANNES filius
Serapionis” in fol. 454v are questions that must be addressed in
future studies.

Abstract: Until recently, no variant copy or cancellation of Konrad Gessner’s “Biblio-
theca Universalis” was known. The author examined five copies in Japan and four
copies at the Zurich Central Library (Copies A, B, C and D), as well as one at Basel
University Library, and discovered that variant copies do exist. Copy A was Gessner’s
own copy, to which he added numerous notes, especially on fol. 454v. As a result of
comparison with Copy B (Konrad Pellikan’s copy), it appears that Gessner corrected the
text of lines 4–30 on this folio, shortened it to 11 lines, and added 18 new lines. The
printer, Froschauer, recomposed four formes from fol. 453r to 454v, reprinted them
and cancelled the former printed sheet of fol. 453r–454v. Copies B and D (Konrad
Klauser’s copy), the Basel copy, and the five copies in Japan are considered to be the
ideal copies and Copies A and C (Jacques Dubois’s copy) are regarded as variant copies.
One part of the printing process of the “Bibliotheca Universalis” became clear with this
discovery.
