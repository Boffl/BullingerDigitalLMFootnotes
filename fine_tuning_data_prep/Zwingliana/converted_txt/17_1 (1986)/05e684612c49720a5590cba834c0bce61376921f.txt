Dating  Huldrych  Zwingli's  Lectures 

on  the  Gospel  of  John 

by  TIMOTHY  J.  WENGERT 

Until  recently  one  of  the  most  surprising  gaps  in  Zwingli  studies  was  the  ab-
sence  of  any systematic  exploration  of  his  New Testament  exegesis. This  lacuna 
was  filled,  however,  in  1976  when  Walter  E. Meyer  published  an  important 
analysis  of  the  dating  and  origin  of  this  material.1  Particularly  helpful  was 
Meyer's  Suggestion  that  Zwingli  lectured  on  the  New  Testament  at  the 
Fraumünster  in  Zürich  during  the  afternoons  from  1525  to  1531. In  all  events 
this article represented  a crucial first  step for modern  researchers' exploration of 
Zwingli's  exegetical  works.  Nevertheless,  given  the  large  number  of  lectures 
which  Meyer attempted  to date (lectures  on  fourteen  books  over seven years), it 
comes  as  no  surprise  that  later  researchers  would  find  it  necessary  to  modify 
and  refine  certain  portions  of  his  reconstruction.  Such  is the  case with  regard  to 
Zwingli's  lectures  on  the  Gospel  of John. 

In  the  course  of  a study  on  the  use  of  Philip  Melanchthon's  Annotationes  in 
Johannem  from  1523,2  it  became  apparent  that  an  accurate  dating  of  Zwingli's 
work  on John  was more  difficult  to  ascertain  than  had  previously  been  thought. 
In  his article  Meyer argued  that  Zwingli  lectured  on John  from July,  1528  until 
the  end  of  that  year. Among  the  reasons  he  gave  for  such  a  dating  are  the  fol-
lowing.  First,  he  pointed  out  that  at  the  end  of  the  manuscript  Version  of 
Zwingli's  lectures  on  John  there  is  a  sermon  entitled,  "Sermo  in  Die  Ioannis 
Euang.:  ex  ore  Zuingli  Io:  21."3  From  this  Meyer  concluded  that  Zwingli 
reached  the  end  of  his work  on John  on  December  27th,  the  Feast  of  St. John 
the  Evangelist. 

Second, because  Zwingli  lectured  on  Mark  from June,  1527  until July,  1528 
and  on  Matthew  during  1529  and  into  1530,4  he  must  have  preached  on  John 
either  in  1526, at the  end  of  1528 or in  1530. Meyer excluded  1526 on  the  basis 
of  references  both  to  the  debate  with  Luther  over  the  Lord's  Supper  and  espe-
cially  over  Christ's  Session  to  God's  right  hand  and  to  Zwingli's  work  from 
1527, Amica exegesis.

Third,  Meyer  opted  for  a  1528  dating  on  the  basis  of  the  brevity  of  com-
ments  on  the  Passion  Narrative.  By the  time  he  lectured  on John,  Zwingli  had 
in  mind  to  cover  these  chapters  more  fully  in  a  harmony  of  the  accounts  of 
Christ's  death  and  resurrection.  This  he  did  in  lectures  which  followed  his 
1529-30  treatment  of  Matthew.5 

Finally,  Zwingli's  comments  on John  reflect  later  developments  of  his  own 
eucharistic  theology,  in  which  he  insists  upon  a  spiritual  presence  of  Christ  in 
the  sacrament.6  Meyer  concluded  that  on  the  weight  of  both  this  internal  evi-
dence  as well as the  external  evidence  described  above these  lectures  must  have 
occupied  Zwingli  from  July  through  December,  1528. 

There  are several  points  at which  a closer  examination  of  the  two sources  for 
Zwingli's  comments  on John  places  Meyer's  conclusion  in  question.7  First,  as 
Meyer  himself  admitted,8  the  sermon  on John  21  is  clearly  an  addition  to  the 
original  text  of  the  annotations.  More  precisely,  it  is  a  separate  sermon  which 
had  no  connection  to  the  original  lectures  on John.  The  differences  in  hand-
writing  between  the  annotations  and  the  sermon  indicates  two  separate  copy-
ists.9 The  sermon  notes  appear  below  the  word  "Finis", with  which  the  original 
hand  had  concluded  the  annotations  on John  21. Finally,  that  Zwingli  should 
have  preached  a sermon  on John  21  at  the  time  of  the  feast  of  St. John  should 
come  as little  or  no  surprise, since  that  was (and  is) the  appointed  text  for  that 
feast  in  Standard  pericopes.10  In  short,  the  appended  sermon  gives  us  no  clues 
whatsoever  concerning  the  dating  of  Zwingli's  lectures. 

5  However, the Johannine passion narative also received less attention in Melanchthon's 
commentary  on John  published  only  a  few  years  earlier.  See  CR  14:1210-1220, 
where only nine füll  columns are devoted to chapters  18-21 of John. In comparison, 
160 columns are used  for  annotations  on  the  first  seventeen  chapters  of  the gospel. 
The brevity of Zwingli's own comments  matches that  of one of his important  refer-
ence works! 

6  Meyer (Anm. 1) p. 302, fn. 74. 
7  The two sources are the manuscript, Ms. Car II  181, pp. 184r-265v, and the Annota-

tiones in Evangelium Ioannis, published  posthumously by Leo Jud  in  1539 as part of 
volume  four  of  Zwingli's works. The latter was republished  in  1836 by  Schuler and 
Schulthess in S VI/I: 682-766. 

8  Meyer (Anm. 1) p. 301. 
9  Ms. Car. II  181, p. 265r. The handwriting of the sermon is much smaller and, for ex-
ample, uses a different  form  of  the  capital letter "A". It matches  the handwriting in 
other  marginal  comments  scattered  throughout  the  manuscript,  especially  those  on 
John 20. 

10  The fact that Zwingli preached on a text out of the Standard pericopes calls into ques(cid:173)

tion the assumption of Meyer(Anm. 1) p. 289 and others that Zwingli always preached 
on the  Biblical books straight through. If Zwingli  completely rejected  the preaching 
on pericope texts, this sermon on John  21 could come from  a very early period in his 
career.

Second,  Meyer  did  not  notice  some  major  discrepancies  between  the  manu-
script  and Jud's  publication  of  Zwingli's  annotations  on John.  Material  on John 
1-5  and  7-9  is similar enough  to assume  that  both  may have been  derived  from 
the  same  lectures. Material  on John 10-14  evinces  only occasional  parallels, and 
that  on John  15-17  shows  only  a  handful  of  agreements.  In  chapter  six  there 
are  some  agreements  on  the  interpretation  of  the  miracle  stories  but  otherwise 
only  sporadic  parallels  on  w.  26,  27,  29-34,  36.  More  importantly,  the  manu-
script  breaks  off  its interpretation  of  chapter  six with  v. 40, concluding  with  the 
words, "Haec  (concerning  the  relation  of  seeing  and  believing)  in  epistola  Ioan: 
in Anno: copiosius. In  hoc  caput  lege  de vera et falsa  religione."11 At  nearly  the 
same  point  (v. 41)  Leo Jud's  Version  of  these  annotations  also  changes  dramati-
cally.  With  the  exception  of  fragmentary  comments  on  w.  41,  51b,  68  and 
70b,12  all the  remaining  comments  come  directly  from  Zwingli's  foremost  writ-
ings  on  the  Lord's  Supper:  De  vera et falsa  religione commentarius,  Eine  klare 
Unterrichtung  vom Nachtmahl  Christi and  Amica  exegesis.13 Jud  simply  took  the 
pertinent  texts  from  those  three  works  and  intercollated  them  verse  by  verse 
into  the  commentary  on  John.14 

Third, with  the  realization  that  there  are  wide  divergences  between Jud's  re-
daction  of  Zwingli's  work  and  the  manuscript  and  with  proof  that Jud  was  not 
beyond  radically  altering  his  sources, the  linchpin  of  Meyer's  argument  for  dat-
ing  the  lectures  gives  way. Taking  the  manuscript  alone, we  find  no  references 
to  Amica  exegesis (published  on  February  28,  1527), to  Christ's  Session  to  God's 
right  hand  or  to  alleosis  -  all  of  which  reflect  Zwingli's  arguments  concerning 
the  Lord's  Supper  after  1527.15 In  fact,  in  one  of  the  few  references  to  Zwingli's 
understanding  of  the  Lord's  Supper  in  the  manuscript,  the  arguments  have 
much  more  in  common  with  Zwingli's  earlier  Statements. Commenting  on  the 
phrase  in  6:39,  "Ego  resuscitabo  eum  in  novissimo  die", Zwingli  notes,  "Quid 
apertius de esu  carnis et sanguinis  Christi. Nam  pater  filium  suum  cibum  presti-
tit  et  hunc  commedentes  perpetuo  victuros  reddit:  non  iussit  ut  dentibus  atte-

11  Ms. Car II  181, p. 223r. 
12  S VI/I: 712f.  (Offenduntur...  atque  confirmat"),  714 ("Morior...  doctrinae  est") and 

719 ("Quemadmodum...  numero" and "Hoc... polliceatur."). 

13  Thus, among the portions of Zwingli's comments on the Lord's Supper from  the an(cid:173)

notations on John which Meyer (Anm. 1) p. 302, fn. 74, regarded as simultaneous with 
Zwingli's  later arguments against  Luther is a direct quote from  the  Commentarius. 
14  In the  Commentarius Zwingli divides his remarks on John  6 into four "notae". In his 
citation  of the  Commentarius, Jud  reduces the "prima  nota" to a marginal  comment. 
(See  the  1539  edition,  p. 305.)  By omitting  the  marginalia,  Schuler  and  Schulthess 
(S VI/I: 714) left  Zwingli's "secunda nota" with no  predecessor. 

15  A  marginal  reference  to  Bucer's  commentary  on John  from  1528  (Ms. Car II  181, 
p. 244r) was added by the same hand which attached the sermon at the end of the an(cid:173)
notations.

ratur."16  Unlike Jud's  edition,  the  manuscript  is  devoid  of  specifically  anti-Lu-
theran  polemic.  Instead,  the  "Papistae"  and  "Catabaptistae"  bear  the  brunt  of 
Zwingli's  attacks.17 

Such attacks, common  to both  the  manuscript  and Jud's  edition, exclude  the 
enticing  possibility  forconnecting  these  annotations  on  John  with  Zwingli's 
own remark from June  25, 1524, "Als ich ietz von  einet das euangelium  Ioannis 
predgen..."18  More  likely,  his  lectures  on  John  at  the  Fraumünster  followed 
hard  and  the  heels  of  his  preaching  at  the  Großmünster.  Thus, we  surmise  that 
Zwingli  lectured  on John  in  1525  or,  at  the  latest,  1526.19  Meyer's  reconstruc-
tion  of  Zwingli's  lectures  leaves the  period  from  1525 and  1526 rather open. By 
placing  Zwingli's  lectures  on John  in  this  time  we  can  allow a longer  period  for 
Zwingli's  lectures  than  the  sixth  months  allowed  in  Meyer's  article.20 

What,  then,  should  be  made  of  differences  found  in Jud's  manuscript?  We 
cannot  exclude  the  possibility  that Jud  himself  is  the  source  of  comments  on 
the  Lord's  Supper  which  reflect  the  later  polemic  against  the  Lutherans.  How-
ever,  that  would  only  account  for  a  small  portion  of  the  many  divergences  be(cid:173)
tween  our  two  sources.  Some  variations  (especially  for  chapters  1-5  and  7-9) 
could  be  the  result  of Jud's  use  of  a second  set  of  notes  for  the  same  lectures.21 
Nevertheless,  as  Meyer  argues  for  Zwingli's  lectures  on  Luke,22  we  would  sug-
gest  for John  as well: that Jud's  annotations  represent  two  separate  attempts  by 
Zwingli  to  interpret  the  Fourth  Gospel, one  of which  occurred  in  1525  or  1526 
and  the  other  of which  may well have come  in  1528 to  1529, between  Zwingli's 
lectures  on  Mark  and  Matthew.23 

16  Ms. Carll  181, pp. 223r. 
17  Specific  references  to  rebaptism  in  comments  on John  3:36,  7:38  and  15:14 indi-

cates  a  terminus  a  quo of January  21,  1525, the  date  of  the  first  rebaptisms.  See 
F. Blanke, Ort  und  Zeit  der  ersten  Wiedertaufe,  Theologische  Zeitschrift  8 (1952) 
74-76. 

18  Z 111:773. 
19  This coincides with  the  reference  to the  annotations  on  I John, cited  above on  p. 4. 
Meyer (Anm. 1), p. 315f., dates those  lectures  to  1526, but he gives little  reason why 
they,  too  could  not  have  been  delivered  in  1525. Notice  Meyer's description  of  the 
content of these annotations (ibid., p. 316), "Erwähnung finden auch hier wieder pole(cid:173)
misch nur die Katholiken  und  die Täufer." 

20  Hence, Meyer's explanation (ibid., p. 302) for why the notes on John, though twice as 
long as those on  Mark, should  be given  during half  the  period  of time is unsatisfac-
tory. 

21  See Meyer's painstaking reconstruction  of the evidence, ibid., pp. 286-289. 
22  Ibid.,  pp. 317-320.  Our  conclusions,  however,  contradict  his  Statement  on  p. 319, 

fn. 151,  about  the  exposition  of  the  other  gospels. "Die  anderen  Evangelien-Ausle(cid:173)
gungen  weisen  keine  derart  auffälligen  Kontraste  und  Frühansätze  Zwinglischer 
Theologie auf.  Sie fügen  sich ohne weiteres in das gleichzeitige  Schrifttum  ein." 

23  The author is indebted to Professor Gottfried  Locher for first suggesting this Solution 

to the problem  in a private conversation  during November,  1980.

The  Gospel  of John  provides  a crucial  battleground  for  a variety  of  theologi-
cal combatants  during  the  sixteenth  Century. By redating  Zwingli's  lectures  and 
suggesting  that Jud's  edition  contains  an  amalgamation  of  notes  from  two  sepa(cid:173)
rate  periods  of  Zwingli's  career,  we  can  shed  light  on  that  important  time  in 
Zwingli's  development  from  1525  to  1528, as  he  begins  to  demarcate  his  own 
territory  on  the  theological  map  of  central  Europe. With  the  dating of  these  lec(cid:173)
tures, we can examine  the  material  itself  for nuances  in  Zwingli's  developing so-
teriology  and  eschatology,  as  well  as  look  more  closely  for  exegetes  who  may 
have  influenced  his  Interpretation  of  this  all-important  gospel.24
