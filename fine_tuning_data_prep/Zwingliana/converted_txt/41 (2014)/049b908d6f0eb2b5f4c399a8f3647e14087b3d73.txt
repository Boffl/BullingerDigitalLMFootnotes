The Understanding of the Church in

Heinrich Bullinger’s Theology

W. Peter Stephens

The church is central to Bullinger’s theology,1 although not the
centre of it.2 Salvation itself is inseparable from the church, so that
he frequently quotes Cyprian’s statement that there is no salvation

discipline and the relation of church and state which are not considered here, are the

outside the church. It is not just that it is the church which has the
message of salvation, but rather that salvation is understood in
terms of a community and not simply in terms of individuals.3 This
is expressed in images of the church, such as God’s house, the body
of Christ, and the vine. After the description of the church in The
Decades as God’s »most excellent work«, Bullinger states that in
his goodness God has chosen men and women »in whom he may
dwell«, and who will be »called by his name a people, a house [...]
or church of the living God«.4

The Context for Understanding Bullinger’s

Teaching on the Church

The emphases in Bullinger’s discussion of the church reflect in part
his controversy with conservative and radical opponents. Debate
with his papal opponents, focuses on the understanding of salva-
tion and scripture in relation to the church, as well as the issue of
unity. With the Anabaptists, beside the unity of the church, there is

of his sermons on the church which is published to represent Bullinger in The Library of
Christian Classics volume on Zwingli and Bullinger: G.W. Bromiley (ed.), Zwingli and
Bullinger, London 1953 (The Library of Christian Classics 24). Selderhuis, Kirche, 516
refers to the church as »the centre of Bullinger’s thought and work«. In his reference to
it as the centre of Bullinger’s thought, he goes beyond his quotation from Bruce Gor-
don, Clerical Discipline and the Rural Reformation: The Synod in Zürich, 1532–1580,
Bern 1992 (Zürcher Beiträge zur Reformationsgeschichte 16), 61: »[...] and the em-
phasis of his work was therefore upon ecclesiology and Church reform«.

3 The Christian’s relation to Christ is not apart from the church, but set in the
church. In commenting on the vine and the branches, Bullinger states that the union of
Christ and the saints is »in the church« (Commentary on John [HBBibl, no. 153], 167r,
l. 35–36). To be orthodox and catholic is also not simply a matter of personal faith, but
is set »in the one and holy church of Christ founded on Christ« (Commentary on
Matthew [HBBibl, no. 144], 32r, l. 35–37). The chapter on the church in the Second
Helvetic Confession begins: »But because God from the beginning has wished people to
be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth, it is absolutely necessary for there
always to have been a church and for there to be now, and to the end of the world.«
(RB 2/2, 310.12–14; RC, 261). In Sermons on the Apocalypse (HBBibl, nos. 327 and
355) the church is related to the preaching of the word rather than to salvation, where
Bullinger maintains that the church will never cease to be, as the word of God will exist
for ever (82.21–22; English translation 183). Linde, Die Lehre, 352 regards the article
on the church as linked to that on justification, which immediately precedes it.

the issue of its membership and therefore of the holiness and ca-
tholicity of the church. These also relate, though in different ways,
to salvation.

From the beginning Bullinger rejects the papal view of the
church, in particular in his maintaining the authority of the word
of God over and against the authority of the church.5 This is de-
veloped at length in 1538 in The Authority of Scripture and in
1571 in A Discourse on Scripture. Bullinger rejects the papal view
that the church is prior to and greater than scripture and that
scripture needs the confirmation or approval of the church. He
argues, initially from the Old Testament, that the word of God,
spoken and written, is prior to the church, indeed that the church
is itself born of the word of God. In this context he deals with the
quotation from Augustine that he would not have believed the
gospel unless the authority of the church had compelled him.6 Ge-
nerally, Bullinger discusses the relation of the church and scripture
in the context of scripture – both before the issue came to a head in
the Council of Trent, as in The Authority of Scripture, and after.
Thus, later, in Evangelical and Papal Teaching (1551),7 it is placed

5 In his Letter to the Margrave of Brandenburg (HBBibl, no. 34), 3v, l. 15–25,
Bullinger defends his teaching against Luther’s assertion that his teaching has been held
for a long time, maintaining that the church is based on God’s word and not length of
time.

6 See the discussion in W. Peter Stephens, The Authority of the Bible in Heinrich
Bullinger’s Early Works, in: Reformation and Renaissance Review 10 (2008), 37–58.
For various discussions of the saying of Augustine, see Commentary on 2 Corinthians
(HBTS 6, 477.19–30); Commentary on Galatians (HBTS 7, 28.32–29.11); The Au-
thority of Scripture (HBTS 4, 37–40) and A Discourse on Scripture (HBBibl, no. 565),
48r–49v. In The Authority of Scripture, Bullinger draws on Gerson’s interpretation of
the church’s role in terms of the primitive church’s witness to Christ, as those who saw
and heard him, and on his inverting the saying into not believing the church unless the
authority of scripture had impelled him. He also cites Marsiglio of Padua’s idea of the
church’s discerning between the voice of the good shepherd and the voice of a stranger,
expressed in recognizing the canonical, but not the apocryphal gospels. The church does
not authenticate the word any more than the sheep authenticate the shepherd’s voice
(HBTS 4, 38.26–39.20). Bullinger adds that the church is the congregation of the faith-
ful. However, as faith comes from the word, the church is dependent on the word. »For
if faith comes through the Holy Spirit from hearing the word of the Lord and faith
makes one a believer, and the church is the assembly of believers, it follows that the
gospel or the word of the Lord is before the church and that the church is born from the
word of God and so it (the word) is prior and greater.« (HBTS 4, 39.29–40.3).

in the opening articles on the authority of scripture, just as it is in
the opening sermons of The Decades on The Word of God.

The other key areas in which Bullinger attacks the papal view of
the church concern Christ and salvation.8 This is evident in his
responses to the Council of Trent in 1551, but it is, of course, also
present in his early works.9 In the articles on the church in Evan-
gelical and Papal Teaching, the evangelical view describes the
church as »built on Christ the rock«. It »hangs on the universal
shepherd, and as it accepts no other name than Christ’s, so it or-
ders itself in accordance with Christ alone«. By contrast Bullinger
describes the papal view as »built on Christ and Peter and his
successors«. It »hangs on Christ [...] but also on the pope as the
universal shepherd [...] and believes that all churches should order
themselves in accordance with the Roman church.« The previous
articles on Christ make a similar contrast. The evangelical view
maintains that »Christ is the only head of his church and never

between evangelical and papal teaching is present in his Reply to Faber (HBBibl, no.
35), D2r, l. 14 – D2v, l. 30, in 1532. See also, for example, a passing reference in
Commentary on 1 Corinthians in 1534: »Ecclesia enim non est domina scripturae, sed
scripturae se subijcit, et omnia sua ad istarum praescriptum agit« (HBTS 6, 271.20–22),
and the more extended discussion in A Discourse on Scripture: »For the authority of
canonical scripture is greater than that of any person, or any bishops, or any synods, or
even the whole church.« Bullinger adds that even if the whole church, past, present, and
future, were gathered in one place, we could not put our faith in anything without the
testimony of scripture. He cites Gerson’s stating that the judgement of one man advan-
cing the scripture is to be preferred to a universal council as well as Augustine’s obser-
vation that it is right even for plenary councils to be corrected by later councils (33r,
l. 16 – 33v, l. 1, 23–25). »For the authority of the gospel does not depend on the
church, but whatever the church has depends on the word of God.« (39r, l. 3–6).

8 Opitz, Heinrich Bullinger als Theologe, 419 rightly stresses the strongly christo-
logical character of Bullinger’s doctrine of the church as well as the centrality of Christ
for Bullinger’s theology: »Theologie ist Christologie, und Ekklesiologie ist nichts an-
deres als erweiterte Christologie.«

9 In 1525 and 1526 Bullinger refers to the church as hanging on Christ, built on the
rock, firmly trusting in Christ, hearing his voice, standing fast with him to the end, and
cleaving to Christ as head (HBTS 1, 162.3,18, 158.15–22; HBTS 2, 111.10–12). Christ
is said to rule in the church (HBTS 2, 112.23). Bullinger later makes as well the me-
dieval moral contrast between Christ and the pope, observing in 1549 that Christ did
not offer his feet to be kissed (Perfection [HBBibl, no. 249], 70.22–71.1). In Commen-
tary on Ephesians, in keeping with one of his principles of interpretation, he interprets
the reference to the prophets and apostles as the foundation of the church in the light of
the other texts, such as 1 Corinthians 3:11, which states that there is no other foun-
dation than Christ (HBTS 7, 158.10–27).

leaves it«. He is »the righteousness [...] of all believers«, so that
through his death, when believers die, they at once attain eternal
life. The papal view regards Christ as »the head of the church«,
but also the pope at Rome, who is »Christ’s vicar on earth«.
Again, Christ is »the righteousness [...] of all believers«, but in the
papal view most believers do not go straight to heaven, but must
be purged in purgatory.10

Bullinger interprets the rock in Matthew 16:18 of Christ and not
of Peter or the pope, claiming that this is the catholic and orthodox
position. He accepts that many in the early church held that Peter
was first or chief in the apostolic college; but that was for Bullinger
a matter of order and administration. He rejects that view that
Peter was the head or foundation of the church. The authority of
prophets and apostles counts for more than the authority of any
human writers – and they refer this to Christ, not Peter. Being
present in his church, Christ has no need of a vicar.11 In The Se-
cond Helvetic Confession, after rejecting the pope as head of the
church, Bullinger attacks the primacy of Rome, as Christ forbade
primacy and dominion among the apostles and their successors.12
In the Council of Trent, Bullinger maintains that God has given
us everything that belongs to salvation in Christ, so that those who
»possess him in true faith« have life in its fullness. As he lives in
the church by his Spirit, he does not need a vicar.13 In Commentary
on Ephesians after referring to Christ as the head of the church,
Bullinger states: »The church lives by the Spirit of Christ«.14 He has
instituted ministers, who preach the gospel and administer the sa-
craments, and effects the salvation of believers in the ministry of
the word and sacraments. For Bullinger, whoever claims what be-
longs to Christ alone or changes what he instituted is anti-Christ.
In contrast to what the pope claims for himself in relation to coun-

and the shepherd as well as that of the head in arguing against having any other head
for the church than Christ (The Christian Religion [HBBibl, no. 283], 98v, l. 21–29).
13 The church is related to the Spirit, but not as pervasively as the church is related
to Christ, although there are many references, such as that Christ rules in the church in
the Spirit (HBTS 2, 112.23, 29–30).

cils, he is seen by those who preach the gospel as the »author of all
the errors and corruptions in the church of God«.15 The reforma-
tion of the church is fundamentally not the work of the reformers,
but the work of Christ. Thus in Perfection Christ is described as
»the most perfect reformer of the church«.16 The reformation of
the church means restoring it to the original form given to it by
God, removing from it abuses and human inventions.

A difference in the understanding of scripture also underlies Bul-
linger’s different understanding of the church from that of the
Anabaptists. In debate with them, Bullinger insists on the deter-
minative role of the whole bible, including the Old Testament.17
This supports his stress on the unity of the Old and New Testa-
ments, with one covenant and one people. In keeping with this he
argues against Anabaptists that the church includes children as
well as adults, and also that the government has a role in the life of
the church. Indeed he refers to magistrates in addition to ministers
as being necessary to the church.18

The different understanding between Bullinger and the Anabap-
tists of membership of the church is related to their different in-
terpretation of scripture as well as to the authority of both the Old
Testament and the New. For Anabaptists the true church consists
of believers living holy lives. For Bullinger, by contrast, the church
in the New Testament, as in the Old, is a mixed church, in which
the godly and ungodly live together until judgement day. In Ana-
baptists (1560), in which he describes their origin and gives his
fullest account of them, Bullinger sees having a separate church as
the fundamental issue with Anabaptists.19

16 Perfection, 41.16–42.1.
17 In a letter to Berchtold Haller on 4 June 1532, Bullinger maintains that the Old
Testament must be used with Anabaptists as well as the New Testament and supports
this with examples from the New Testament (HBBW 2, 130.9–11, 131.62–132.85). The
role of the Old Testament is evident in his early work on baptism (HBTS 2, 72.3–8).

18 In The Testament (1534), Bullinger refers to the need for the magistrate to deal
with evil people who subvert the church and attacks those who exclude them from the
church (The Testament [HBBibl, no. 54], 19r, l. 18 – 19v, l. 4, 19v, l. 12 – 20r, l. 1).
Compare the preface (aaa6r, l.3–6) in Commentary on Matthew. In The Decades, Bul-
linger can say: »No one denies that God often uses the work of soldiers and magistrates
in defending the church against the ungodly and tyrants« (HBTS 3, 758.27–29; Har-
ding, vol. 4, 34).

The Understanding of the Church in Heinrich Bullinger’s Theology

63

This issue features largely in Anabaptist Teaching (1531). In the
opening epistle he refers to a key text, »God is not a God of dis-
cord, but of peace«.20 For Bullinger, Anabaptists have no ground
for separation. If they preach scripturally, as Bullinger does, why
do they separate?21 Separation is not something they have learnt in
Christ.22 The sixth article rejecting Anabaptist teaching states that
re-baptism is rebellion against Christian unity.23 Moreover, he re-
jects their claim to be sent by God, as God is not a God of discord,
but of peace and unity.24 In the third of his twenty five articles
Bullinger maintains that Christ and the apostles did not rebel ab-
out outward, temporal things, but acted for the peace of the
church.25 By outward things Bullinger means things which do not
concern salvation. He charges Anabaptists with separating for out-
ward things, such as interest, tithes, water, riches, and government,
contrary to Christ’s example.26 Bullinger defends himself against
the charge of separation, although he implies that separation is
right when the truth of the gospel is at stake. He maintains that
Anabaptist preaching deals with outward things, whereas he, by
contrast, deals with faith, innocence, and love.27 The following
year, in The Prophet, Bullinger condemns those who desert the
church for a trivial reason and whose view and practice of baptism
divide the church.28

19 Anabaptists deserted other churches. They maintained that in their churches there
was manifest amendment of life. By contrast, in evangelical churches, although they
preached some things from the gospel, there was no amendment or repentance. There
can be no fellowship with those who are impure. (Anabaptists [HBBibl, no. 396], 17v,
l. 15–26, 18r, l. 17–28).

that »they sin most gravely against God himself and all things sacred who disturb the

The Church – Catholic and Holy

There is a broad picture of the church in many of his works, but
Bullinger’s view is presented most clearly and systematically in Se-
cond Response to Cochlaeus, The Decades, and The Second Hel-
vetic Confession.29 The Decades contains Bullinger’s most com-
prehensive discussion of the church and it provides the most co-
herent presentation of his view of the church.30 It is in a measure
an exposition of the Apostles’ Creed, which he sees as »a compen-
dium of scripture«.31 There is a brief consideration in the first
decade and a more extended one in the fifth. Although his presen-
tation reflects the words of the creed, the accents and emphases are
Bullinger’s.

He starts, as the creed, with the word »believe« and the distinc-
tion between »believing« and »believing in«, before turning to the
church as catholic and holy. »Believing in« belongs only to God
and not to what is created. In the creed, the words »believing in«
apply to the Holy Spirit and not to the church or to the other
phrases, such as the forgiveness of sins. In support, Bullinger draws
on Cyprian, Augustine, Paschasius, Leo, and Aquinas to demon-
strate the difference between believing in God and believing the
church.32 In The Christian Religion, »Believing the church« means
that we are »incorporated into this holy church, have communion
with God and all his saints, and that within it we share in the Holy
Spirit and all the holiness, which he has granted to his church, and
so we are also truly holy.«33

unity (salvation in Christ) in one body and gather it together through the sacraments
[...] so that they may be one in Christ and there may be no dissensions and sects in the
church [...]« (Commentary on Matthew, 31v, l. 43–48).

29 For Second Response to Cochlaeus, see HBBibl, no. 160. There is a brief, but
comprehensive picture of the church in The Christian Religion (97–100), in effect a
more popular version of The Decades.

30 Much of the substance is adumbrated in his Second Response to Cochlaeus in

1544.

32 After citing Cyprian, who distinguishes the creator from what is created and what
is divine from what is human, he quotes Paschasius’ words »we believe the church, as
the mother of regeneration; we do not believe in the church, as the author of salvation.«
(HBTS 3, 100.30–31, 101.1–2; Harding, vol. 1, 159).

The Understanding of the Church in Heinrich Bullinger’s Theology

65

Bullinger generally uses »church« of the Christian church, but he
can refer to a Jewish or Muslim church.34 Usually, however, he
defines the church in terms of the faithful or the saints, but also
occasionally in terms of the elect. (The words »believer« and
»elect« are sometimes seemingly parallel terms in description of
the church, as in Firm Foundation.)35 In the fifth decade, the
church is described as »the company of the faithful calling on the
name of the Lord« or »all the faithful [...] in heaven and on earth«,
»fellow heirs with the saints from Adam to the end of the world«,
and »the faithful and elect of God«.36 In the first decade Bullinger
relates the church to faith, salvation, and the profession of Christ.
He describes it as »the communion of all who profess the name of
Christ«, »all the faithful«, and »all who are saved and shall be
saved to the end of the world«.37

Although the creed describes the church as holy and catholic.
Bullinger begins with the word catholic, before giving a longer
exposition of the church as holy. It is catholic in time – being both
militant and triumphant. It extends across the ages, including those
who lived before and after Christ, and embraces all the faithful
from Adam himself to the last saint at the end of the world. It is
also catholic or universal in space as well as time, and includes all
particular churches, which are described as being »as it were mem-
bers in one body under one head«.38 Already in his Comparison of
Ancient and Contemporary Heresies in 1526 he has contrasted the

34 The Christian Religion, 98v, l. 7–13.
35 Firm Foundation (HBBibl, no. 426), 35r, l. 17–21.
36 HBTS 3, 740.20–21, 741.5–6, 742.22–25. – The double description of the church
in terms of faith and holiness is clearly expressed in the exposition of Matthew 16:18:
»The church is the assembly of all the truly faithful, who, grafted by faith in Christ, are
being sanctified by the Spirit, and who live by the Spirit of Christ and do works of
righteousness, sincerity, and love.« (Commentary on Matthew, 157r, l. 17–19). In The
Second Helvetic Confession, the church is described first as »an assembly of the faith-
ful« and then, reflecting the creed, as »a communion of all the saints«, a term which
essentially elaborates the word »faithful« with the amplification of »being sanctified by
the blood of the Son« or »who truly know and rightly worship and serve the true God
[...] and who by faith share the benefits freely offered«. Later, in the same chapter
Bullinger refers to those who enjoy Christ in the church as »the elect«. (RB 2/2,
310.14–18, 311.28–30; RC, 261, 266). The communion of saints is in effect »an ex-
planation of what we understand by the church« (The Christian Religion, 100r,
l. 26–28).

character of the church as catholic or universal in space with the
Donatist limiting of the church in Africa and the limiting of it to
those linked to Rome by papal preachers.39

In Questions of Religion, Bullinger discusses the question whe-
ther the Roman church, as a local church, can be catholic or uni-
versal.40 It is rather, he argues, that like other local churches, it is a
member of the catholic church. It is also not catholic both because
it is impure and because it lacks the signs of the true church. The
word of truth is not only not preached in it, but it is forbidden and
persecuted with sword and fire. It is new, and not the ancient
Roman church.41

The reference to the catholic church as triumphant and militant,
leads to a discussion of the church as holy. Unlike the church
triumphant, the church militant is mixed. (Strictly speaking only
the elect and faithful are members of the church militant »joined to
Christ not only with outward bands or marks but also in spirit and
truth, and sometimes by these and not by bands or marks«.) Bul-
linger distinguishes the visible church from the invisible church.
Unlike God, we cannot judge who are elect and faithful. They are
known or visible to him, but they are invisible or unknown to us,
in the sense that we do not know what they are inwardly.42

In the first decade, in a characteristically trinitarian way, Bullin-
ger describes the church as holy, as it has been sanctified by God
the Father in the blood of the Son and the gift of the Holy Spirit.
The church is pure, not on its own account, but Christ’s. It is not
perfect while here on earth, but its holiness is »most perfect in

Christ«, for it has been washed by the blood of Christ (cf. John
13:10). This understanding of holiness is continued in Bullinger’s
reference to the communion of saints which expresses our com-
munion with God and with others, and »our sharing in good and
heavenly things«.43

The church is a mixed body, as we see in the parables of wheat
and tares and good and bad fish. Bullinger recognizes, using the
examples of David and Peter, that holy people can fall, but that,
unlike Judas, who also fell,44 they do not totally forsake Christ. We
cannot tell which is which, for we can judge only the outward
appearance and not the inward reality. It is here that Bullinger and
Anabaptists differ.45

In the fifth decade, Bullinger discusses this issue in examining
whether the church may err. He argues that the church trium-
phant, unlike the church militant, can never err. The church mili-
tant, however, which includes the good and faithful and the evil
and hypocrites, both errs and does not err in life and doctrine.46
The church does not err in doctrine and faith, »for it hears only the
voice of the Shepherd«. Based on the foundation of the prophets
and apostles, the church can be described as the pillar and ground
of the truth. It errs, however, when »it turns from Christ and his
word«. The Old Testament shows that the church can and does

43 HBTS 3, 102.6–33; Harding, vol. 1, 162–163. – For Opitz, Heinrich Bullinger als

Theologe, 419, the church is essentially the communion of the saints.

44 In The Second Helvetic Confession he gives examples not only of Christians who
fail, as Peter, but also of churches in which there are serious offences, as in Galatia and
Corinth (RB 2/2, 315.9–13; RC, 266).

45 HBTS 3, 745.35–746.17, 747.5–12, 747.36–748.5; Harding, vol. 4, 13–17.
46 Bullinger discusses the issue in The Origin of Error (HBBibl, no. 10), d1r, l. 18 –
d1v, l. 4. In response to those who say that the church cannot err, Bullinger states that
the sheep who hear the voice of the shepherd belong to the Lord’s sheepfold (d1r,
l. 18–24). (The importance of »hearing the shepherd’s voice« is evident in its constant
use by Bullinger.) In The Authority of the Bible in replying to Cochlaeus, Bullinger
challenges the view that the church without qualification cannot err, affirming that the
church cannot err only as it is governed by the rule of canonical scripture which is
inspired by the Holy Spirit (HBTS 4, 87.9–10, 88.25–27, 89.22–25). He also gives
examples from the Old Testament of the church’s erring by abandoning the light of
God’s word, which happens despite God’s promises to dwell in them and be their God
(HBTS 4, 91.27–92.21). Compare Second Response to Cochlaeus, 8v, l. 30– 9r, l. 40. In
The Second Helvetic Confession he expresses this succintly. The church »does not err as
long as it rests upon the rock Christ, and upon the foundation of the prophets and
apostles«. (RB 2/2, 311.27–28; RC, 263).

err, when a part of it, having lost God’s word, errs; it does not err
altogether, inasmuch as some remnants are preserved by the grace
of God, by whom the truth may flourish again [...]«. Paul could
describe the churches of Corinth and Galatia, despite their failings,
as »the holy churches of God«.

The church on earth errs in life, as it will never be free of sin. It
will always have to pray »Forgive us our trespasses«. For Bullin-
ger, there neither is nor will be any church on earth that is »with-
out blemish«. At the same time the church, which has blemishes,
can be described as pure, as without spot or wrinkle, because of
God’s mercy and forgiveness (Galatians 3:22); for on account of
Christ’s innocence such spots are not imputed to those who em-
brace Christ by faith. The church strives to have as few spots as
possible, but it is »chiefly by the benefit of imputation« that the
church is without spot or wrinkle.47 The mixed character of the
church militant raises the question of whether and, if so, how we
can recognize such a mixed body as the church.

The Marks of the Church

There are two principal outward marks by which we may know
the church militant: the sincere preaching of the word of God and
the lawful partaking of the sacraments of Christ.48 Bullinger sees
Matthew 28:19, Ephesians 5:25–26, and Acts 2:38 as evidence
that the New Testament regards word and sacrament as the means

47 HBTS 3, 759.4–760.8, 760.27–33; Harding, vol. 4, 35–38.
48 Bullinger notes that some add to word and sacrament: »zeal for godliness and
unity, patience in suffering (in cruce), and calling on the name of God through Christ«,
but he regards them as included in the others. He observes that in Acts 2:42 zeal for
unity and love and calling on the name of God are with the eucharist joined to the
sacrament of baptism, mentioned in other places (HBTS 3, 748.17–19, 748.37–749.1;
Harding, vol. 4, 17–18). The church’s suffering and the reasons for it are considered at
length in Persecution (HBBibl, no. 575) in 1573. His Sermons on the Apocalypse was
written for churches suffering persecution. He maintains that the true church always
has been, is, and shall be subject to adversity and persecution. Bullinger uses the
teaching of Jesus and the Book of Revelation both to show that suffering was pro-
phesied and to offer consolation (a2r, l. 28 – a2v, l. 4, a5v, l. 6–29, b3v, l. 19 – b4r,
l. 30). Suffering and indeed persecution are seen to be marks of the church throughout
Bullinger’s ministry, for example, in The Testament, 38v, l. 12 – 41v, l. 17.

The Understanding of the Church in Heinrich Bullinger’s Theology

Christ uses to establish a church and with further biblical testi-
monies he maintains that word and sacrament are outward marks
of the church. »For these bring us into the society of the ecclesial
body and keep us in it.«49

In giving these traditional outward marks of the church, Bullin-
ger does not exclude from the church all those without them. »For
there are undoubtedly many in the world who do not hear the
ordinary preaching of God’s word, who do not come into the com-
pany of those who call on God, and who do not receive the sac-
raments.« Bullinger is not referring to those who despise these
things, but those, such as the sick or imprisoned, who cannot have
the word and sacrament that they desire. After citing the biblical
precedent of the exile in Babylon, he also includes those, for ex-
ample, in Persia and Arabia, who are deprived by Muslim ungod-
liness and cruelty. They are joined in the same spirit and the same
faith with those who have the visible signs.50 In The Second Hel-
vetic Confession, Bullinger maintains that the church is not bound
by its signs, so that those who do not share in the sacraments are
outside the church. This was true in the Old Testament of those in
exile in Babylon who were deprived of their sacrifices for seventy
years.51

For Bullinger, however, it is not sufficient to state that word and
sacrament are marks of the church, as the Arians had the word,
but used it contrary to »the sense of scripture and the orthodox
faith or the articles of the faith«. (Arians had the adulterated word,
not the pure or sincere word of God.) Similarly, those who have
the sacraments must use them lawfully, unlike Jeroboam. He did
not sacrifice lawfully and was regarded as having defected from
the true church. However, if heretics administer baptism in the
threefold name to the catholic faith and not to error, it is »not the
baptism of heretics but the baptism of the church«. Nevertheless,
that does not make heretics the true church.52

exposition of Acts 2, Bullinger states that »the true, ancient and apostolic church« is the
church which has scriptural teaching in which evil is challenged and penitence and the
remission of sins are preached. He adds that we »do not doubt the church of Christ to

70

There are also inward marks of the church.53 Unlike the outward
marks which characterize the church militant with its mixture of
believers and hypocrites, the inward marks belong only to the god-
ly. They make the outward marks fruitful and they make people
acceptable and pleasing to God where, by some necessity, the out-
ward signs are missing. »They are the communion of the Spirit of
the Lord, sincere faith, and twofold love.« (Later, he says that by
these we can easily tell whether or not someone is »in the fellow-
ship of the church«.) They unite the faithful to Christ the head and
to the other members of the church. The New Testament teaches
that »Christ is joined to us by his Spirit and we are bound to him
by faith, so that he lives in us and we in him«. Christ gives us his
Spirit and by the Spirit people »burn with the love of God«.54

The word is a mark of the church, as it is from the word of God
that the church is born and indeed built up and preserved. Bullin-
ger supports this with a range of New Testament testimonies, such
as »for faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God«
(Romans 10:17), and it is by faith that we are made true members
of Christ and his church. Bullinger contrasts this with the Roman
view which, in effect by the role it gives to human decrees and
doctrines, sets up a human church rather than the Christian church
which is founded by Christ’s word. It is for this reason that God

be« where we see baptism and the eucharist, prayer, fellowship, and love. (Commentary
on Acts [HBBibl, no. 43], 37v, l. 8–20). He then contrasts these with their corrupt
forms in the Church of Rome. Fast, Heinrich Bullinger und die Täufer, 143, is therefore
mistaken in seeing Bullinger as moving towards the Anabaptists in 1560, where, besides
referring to word and sacrament, he mentions prayer and love. He has stated this
already in 1533 in his commentary on Acts.

53 In The Christian Religion Bullinger gives a concentrated exposition of the church
in the context of the creed (97v–100v). Perhaps for that reason, in mentioning the
inward and outward marks of the church, he mentions the fellowship of the Spirit
before the word through which it becomes the church. Although Bullinger often repeats
what he has said in other works, he frequently includes new elements. Here the church
is described as living in the fear of God, in love and unity with all people, particularly its
fellow members and serving God with patience in suffering. These are given with pe-
nitence and amendment of life as signs of the church which one finds in Acts. (98v,
l. 20 – 99r, l. 10).

54 HBTS 3, 751.22–28, 32–35, 752.25–26, 753.27–28; Harding, vol. 4, 23–24, 26. –
Faith, in the sense of trust in God’s mercy and the outward confession of faith, unites us
to each other as well as to Christ (HBTS 3, 752.30–39).

has given teachers »to found, build, maintain, and enlarge his
church by his word, his word alone«.55

In The Second Helvetic Confession he emphasizes the word as
the mark of the church, saying that the true church has »the signs
or marks of the true church«, »especially the lawful and sincere
preaching of the word of God as it was delivered to us in the book
of the prophets and the apostles which all lead us to Christ«, who
said in the gospel, »My sheep hear my voice [...]« (John 10:5, 27,
28). This is followed by a passage in which he mentions partici-
pation »in the sacraments, instituted by Christ, delivered to us by
the apostles« and »used in no other way than as they received
them from the Lord«. He mentions these, however, in the midst of
several inward marks such as love. The word is, no doubt, em-
phasized as it leads to the true worship of the one God, and the
seeking of salvation in Christ alone as mediator, intercessor, and
head of the church.56

In the light of these two marks, Bullinger rejects the papal view
that »they have a most certain mark of the apostolic church in the
continued succession of bishops coming from St Peter [...] to Julius
III [...]« Bullinger does not deny that »the sure succession of pas-
tors in the primitive church was of great weight«, but argues that
since the time of Gregory the Great the larger part of the bishops
have not been true shepherds but devouring wolves, as Zechariah
prophesied (Zechariah 11:15–17). Succession does not guarantee
that a church is apostolic. An apostolic church is one which pre-
serves the apostles’ teaching through which the church »is preser-
ved and will be spread till the end of the world«. Bullinger sup-
ports this by observing that the true prophets of God in the Old
Testament did not stand in a continual succession of priests and yet
those believing them are held to be the true church. Furthermore,
Christ was opposed by those who were supported by the succes-
sion of high priests (pontifices),57 and yet they were not regarded as
the true church; and the apostles also could not appeal to a suc-
cession of high priests, »and yet the church gathered by them is

57 The word »pontifex« is used for high priests as well as for popes. See, for exam-

ple, Commentary on Luke (HBBibl, no. 173), 128r, l. 39–42 and 130v, l. 32–38.

recognized by everyone to be the true and holy church«. Charac-
teristically, by reference to Tertullian, Bullinger draws on patristic
as well as biblical testimony in support of the apostolicity of chur-
ches which do not have a succession of bishops, but whose
teaching is that of the apostles.58

In Questions of Religion, Bullinger responds to the question
how one can recognise the true Christian church. He does not
answer by giving the external and internal marks but combines
them in a distinctive way. With biblical references he states that we
recognize it »primarily by true faith and the pure word of God, by
love and innocence and the amendment of life and by the constant
and patient calling on the name of God«. He then adds the sac-
raments which are, however, not present in some situations – and
that is why he has given first place to the others.59 He rejects the
papal view that one can recognize the true church by the succes-
sion of bishops, as can be seen by the succession of high priests in
the Old Testament. It is conformity with the teaching of the apost-
les which makes the church apostolic. Acts 20 warns that some of
those succeeding the apostles would be wolves.60

In The Second Helvetic Confession Bullinger rejects unity and
antiquity, as well as the succession of bishops, as marks of the
church. He does not there elaborate antiquity. Unity refers to the
charge that the evangelicals were divided, unlike the Roman
Church with its one head, the pope. Bullinger replies by pointing to
the Roman church’s »sects, contentions, and quarrels«. He em-
phasizes that there was no disorder in the church before there was
a pope and that »God was in the apostolic church and that it was a
true church, even though there were disputes and dissensions in
it«. Moreover, the »most distinguished doctors of the church have
differed among themselves on important matters [...] without the
church’s ceasing to be the church«.61

The Church as One

In a separate sermon Bullinger describes the church as one, a word
not used in the Apostles’ Creed. The church is one in the senses he
has already stated – before Christ and after Christ, on earth and in
heaven.62 After two brief biblical references, Bullinger draws on
Cyprian and Lactantius to argue his case for the church as one,
even when it spreads throughout the world. It is like a tree with
many branches or a spring with many streams. Indeed, the church
is called catholic or universal, because all these members are united
perpetually in one body under one head Christ. The church is one:
both the church militant and the church triumphant and the
church before Christ’s coming and the church after his coming.
Drawing on Augustine, he argues that the fact that the church is
mixed does not make two churches any more than having traitors
and true citizens in a nation makes two nations. Therefore when
people depart from the church they do not destroy its unity, but
leave it purer. He cites Cyprian and Lactantius to support his view
that there is no salvation and no people acceptable to God outside
the church. »Whoever is separated from the church is joined to an
adulteress.«63

Bullinger does not, as elsewhere, discuss why there is only one
church. In Perfection the unity of the church derives from there
being »one God, one saviour, one faith, one baptism«.64 In The
Second Helvetic Confession he gives a comprehensive account of
why there is one church: »And since there is always one God, and

62 The sense of the church as one is expressed in part in various ways and contexts in
his early writings. There is one church before and after Christ as there is one covenant.
In Reply to Burchard the covenant is one and eternal, and so »we and the ancients
before Christ are one people, one church, with one God, covenant, and faith« (HBTS 2,
151.31–33). The constant affirmation that there is one church before and after Christ is
related, but not limited to Bullinger’s understanding of the covenant. In 1525 in a reply
to Bullinger, Leo Jud cites Lactantius’ reference to »one church of those before and
those after Christ who are saved by the one Christ« (HBBW 1, 81.19–22; cf. HBTS 2,
78.27–79.7).

63 HBTS 3, 767.26–769.24; Harding, vol. 4, 49–52. – There is a possible qualifi-
cation in The Second Helvetic Confession in the words »no certain salvation«. It states
that »as there was no salvation outside Noah’s ark [...] so, there is no certain salvation
outside Christ« (RB 2/2, 314.26–31; RC, 266).

one mediator between God and people, Jesus the Messiah, and one
shepherd of the whole flock, one head of this body, and, to con-
clude, one Spirit, one salvation, one faith, one testament or cove-
nant, it necessarily follows that there is only one church.«65 He
expresses this more succintly in Two Sermons where he states that
the unity of the church is from God and disunity from the devil.66
The fact that there are two people (Jews and Gentiles) and two
Testaments (Old and New) does not make two churches, any more
than the fact that there is a church militant (with many particular
churches) and a church triumphant. »There is salvation in one
Messiah, in whom they are united as members of one body under
one head, in the same faith, and sharing in the same spiritual food
and drink.« As the body of Christ they all receive life from Christ,
the head.67

There is an extended discussion of the unity of the church in
Questions of Religion, written by Bullinger to help those who are
persecuted to answer questions put to them. It is part of his answer
to questions whether there is salvation outside the Roman church
and whether those who intentionally separate from it are to be
regarded as heretics and apostates. He maintains that in German
and Hebrew the word heretic is related to separation and that in
Latin it is expounded similarly by the word sect. Where separation
or heresy occurs there must have been unity. In the light of Mat-
thew 10:34–35 and the separation of the apostles from Judaism,
Bullinger holds that there can be a false unity. He is concerned,
however, to examine true unity. »As there is one God, one world,
one Son and so on, so there is only one divine truth, only one true
Christian faith and only one universal Christian church, in which
all believers obey and adhere to the divine truth alone, love the one
true God with all their heart and soul and strength, adore, invoke,
and worship him alone.« Bullinger expounds this further in terms
of Christ as the only saviour in whom there is fullness or perfec-
tion. Believers »have everything in Christ alone and need and de-

65 RB 2/2, 310.25–29; RC, 262. – The unity of the church in The Christian Religion
is related to the one God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (100r, l. 17–21). In The Insti-
tution of the Eucharist, it is related to the Spirit (HBTS 2, 102.11–12).

75

sire nothing more«. They trust »in the Father alone, through Jesus
Christ, God’s Son, in the power of the Holy Spirit«. Through the
sacraments they pledge themselves to God and his church and
serve one another in love.68

The church in the Old Testament was also one. God gave one
law, one covenant, one temple, one sacrifice, one priesthood.
Moreover, they had their sacraments which »served this unity, so
that they were one people under one God and one faith«. Bullinger
maintains that Jeroboam divided the one and only congregation,
withdrawing the ten tribes from the one temple and sacrifice, and
from the prescribed worship, and following his own pleasure he
built two churches or temples, with idols. After him came Ahab
who led them even further from unity. A comparable disunity oc-
curred in the early church as people, for example, rejected doc-
trines such as the trinity and asserted human merit against divine
grace. Bullinger compares this with the Roman church’s preferring
its own views to God’s word, invoking created things and not God
alone, and denying that salvation is in Christ alone. The reformers
would have been heretics and dividers of the church if they had
done these things, but in fact they have been engaged in restoring
»the ancient and first simplicity and unity of the true faith and of
the true Christian and apostolic church«. This led them to leave
the Roman church, but not the ancient Roman church.69

from the church. Anabaptists

Bullinger’s emphasis on the unity of the church presents him
with a double challenge: to convict the Anabaptists for separating
from the church, while defending the apparent separation of evan-
gelicals
separate because the
church’s life and teaching are not pure, its discipline is not strict
enough, and its ministers are marred by faults and vices.70 These
are wrong reasons for separating. They lead Bullinger to outline
the right and the wrong reasons for separation from the church in
relation to the teaching, life, and discipline of the church.

Bullinger allows that one may separate where the teaching of an
immutable doctrine of the church is at stake, such as the doctrines
of the creed and the doctrines of salvation, for example, justifica-

tion by faith. When, however, the scriptures are expounded and
applied, what is fundamental is that nothing is said »contrary to
the truth of the faith or the love of God and our neighbours«.
Bullinger maintains that there will be diversity in interpretation,
but such diversity is not a reason for separation.71 Moreover, fol-
lowing Augustine, Bullinger argues that even if someone errs gross-
ly in interpretation, one may admonish the person, but still not
separate from the church. Similarly, applying Christ’s word in
Matthew 23:2–3, Bullinger states that a minister’s life is not a
ground for separation, while the minister teaches faithfully and
distributes the two sacraments lawfully. It is different if a minister
does not teach the faith rightly. Christ commands us to flee from
false prophets, which means from false doctrine, not from evil life.
There are two other matters which do not justify separation: di-
versity in ceremonies and impurity in members’ lives, which pol-
lutes other people. Bullinger maintains that there has always been
diversity in ceremonies and quotes Socrates, Irenaeus, and Augus-
tine to show that in the early church there was unity despite great
diversity,72 and that Paul in the case of Corinth and Jesus himself
with Judas did not regard a person’s evil life as a reason for se-
parating from the church. Typically Bullinger concludes his case by
combining scripture and the early church. He quotes Cyprian’s
charging those who judge in this way with usurping the role which
the Father has given to the Son.73

Bullinger has to defend his understanding of the church in two
directions: against »defenders of the Roman monarchy« and
against Anabaptists. He is charged by the former of a crime similar
to the one he condemns in the latter. Their charge is of having
deserted the old Roman church in which scripture has authority

71 Bullinger distinguishes what Paul commands in 2 Thessalonians 3:6 from what
the Anabaptists do, for they in separating from the church set up a private church
(Commentary on 2 Thessalonians [HBBibl, no. 81], 85r, l. 13–17).

72 This is expressed rather differently in The Second Helvetic Confession which
states both that diversity in rites does not dissolve the unity of the church and that unity
does not lie in rites and ceremonies but in the truth and unity of the catholic faith (RB
2/2, 316.3–13, RC, 267–268). There are differences between the church in the Old
Testament and the church in the New, but they are parts of the one church. Therefore
many differences, for example, in ceremonies, can exist without division.

and the sacraments have their place, simply because of the faults of
some of the bishops and priests. This leads Bullinger to define
heretics and schismatics and to argue that evangelicals are nei-
ther.74

Following Augustine, he relates heretics to doctrine and schis-
matics to separation. Heretics are further described as advancing
and spreading strange views, contrary to scripture, the articles of
faith, and doctrines based on God’s word. Bullinger defines what it
is to be Christian and catholic in terms of the imperial edict as
continuing the religion (concerning the trinity) that St Peter taught
at Rome and which Damasus and Peter of Alexandria also taught.
In describing schismatics, Bullinger adds the gathering and joining
of other congregations to the fundamental idea of separation. Bul-
linger insists that it is because of their fidelity to scripture and the
councils of the church, that evangelicals reject the pope’s false
teaching and his new unscriptural decrees, as well as papal abuses
and corruption. »We flee and reject their tyranny and anti-Chris-
tianity, but we do not reject Christ and his yoke, nor flee the
fellowship of the saints.« »Escaping from the papal church we are
gathered into the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church.«75 In
writing on the papal bull against Elizabeth, he maintains that to be
true catholics people must leave the Roman church which has de-
parted from the faith and practice of the apostolic and primitive
church and join evangelicals who are true catholics.76

Bullinger distinguishes the old apostolic Roman church, to
which his opponents appeal, from the present Roman church. He
identifies with the former, but rejects the latter. He does not re-
cognize this church, which »acknowledges and worships the pope
as Christ’s vicar on earth and obeys his laws, to be the true church
of Christ«. At the same time he judges that there are many in that
church »who worship Christ and have kept themselves free from
papal pollution«. Despite its claims this new Roman church does

preface to Commentary on Luke, Bullinger maintains that those who believe that Christ
is the head of the church shrink from the pope (AA4v, l. 24–25). He later states, »The
faith of Peter and the faith of the pope, the teaching of Peter and the teaching of the
pope are diametrically opposed.« (128r, l. 39–40).

not have the outward or inward marks of the church. Indeed, it
cannot be tolerated as one tolerates hypocrites and evil people in
the church, because »the Romanists are the worst and most cruel
enemies of Christ’s truth, openly blaspheming the gospel and per-
secuting believers in Christ«. They subject the bible and its inter-
pretation to the pope, so that they reject as heretics those who, like
scripture, call Christ the only head of the church, unless they add
the pope to be the head of the church on earth.77 Bullinger main-
tains that this and other examples show that the Roman church is
destitute of the word of God and therefore »is not the true church
of Christ«. He also rejects Roman administration of the Lord’s
Supper, but not their administration of baptism. Therefore in his
judgement the Roman church lacks both the outward and inward
marks of the church.78

It is fundamental for Bullinger that the church of God has ex-
isted from the beginning and does not cease when leaders of the
church, as in the church of Rome, prove faithless. He argues this
with five examples from the Old Testament, when word and sac-
rament, the outward signs of the church, were suppressed. At these
times God sent prophets, such as Elijah, who spoke his word, al-
though they were not acknowledged by the leaders. God also had a
remnant who remained faithful, such as the seven thousand who
had not bowed the knee to Baal. This faithful remnant might be
unknown to others, as the seven thousand were unknown to Eli-
jah. However, despite the suppression of word and sacrament, they
partook of all the gifts of God through faith.79

With these biblical precedents, Bullinger is able to argue that
God has a church on earth, although the Roman church is not the
church. Everywhere there have been some who have »acknowl-
edged Christ the Lord to be the only author of salvation«. More-

77 Bullinger gives further examples of where Rome calls heretics those who hold
what scripture teaches (HBTS 3, 785.10–13; Harding, vol. 4, 68). Generally Bullinger
simply contrasts the pope’s claiming to be head of the church with Christ’s being the
only head of the church, which is his body. But he also rejects the view that the pope
saves the church from disorder. For Bullinger, the government of the church handed
down by the apostles maintained order in the early church (RB 2/2, 313.1–8; RC, 264).

over, in almost every age, God has sent »godly and learned men«
»who challenge the tyranny of the pope, demanding the purging of
the church from papal corruptions, and teaching the true doctrine
of salvation and the true use of the sacraments«. Nevertheless, the
pope condemned, excommunicated, and even killed those »who
preached the word of God and demanded the reformation of the
church«. (This opposition was, indeed, foretold by Christ and by
the prophets and apostles.) However, people could still be saved in
this unreformed church, because, for example, the Apostles’ Creed
(»the most perfect rule of saving faith«) was recited to the dying.
Moreover, God, who saved the thief on the cross, would undoub-
tedly have mercy on those oppressed by anti-Christ and teach them
by the Holy Spirit.80 Bullinger supports the reformation of the
church of his day, by reference to biblical and especially apostolic
precedent, arguing indeed for a reformation in the likeness of the
apostolic church.81 At the same time, however, he defends with-
drawal from the church.

In his letter to Edward VI, Bullinger rejoices at »the renovation
of religion« in England and argues that there is no need to wait for
a general council to reform the church. His case is negative (the
precedent of medieval councils) and positive (the example of Josiah
and the early church). He describes medieval councils as having led
to superstition and error in doctrine and corruption rather than to
amendment or reformation in the church, as they did not accept
the authority of God’s word. In particular he attacks the role of
Rome which ultimately determines the councils’ outcome. In any
council it called, Rome would rather that the gospel, along with
Christ and the true church, perished than forgo its decrees, rites,
authority , or wealth. By contrast Josiah called a council of princes
and priests and did not refer the judgement to the high priest, but
submitted himself to the law of God without paying any regard to
ancient custom. He defends the calling of in effect a local council
by the precedent of the early church, with its provincial councils,
and in particular of Cyprian. They dealt with matters of faith and

the reformation of the churches and, moreover, made no mention
of the Bishop of Rome.82

Bullinger defends the withdrawal of evangelicals from the Ro-
man church as »lawful and necessary« for salvation. He cites the
words of Christ and the apostles »to flee from anti-Christ, idola-
try, and false prophets«. He contrasts this with other types of with-
drawal, such as apostasy, schism, and heresy. He gives examples of
each of them, citing apostates, such as Julian, schismatics, such as
the Donatists, and heretics, such as Arius. The evangelical with-
drawal is »not from the true, but from the false church«. It is »not
from the people of God, but from the persecutors of God’s peo-
ple«. It is »not from the articles of the faith and the sound doctrine
of the church , but from errors which obscure« them. It is »not for
innovation [...] but for the recovery of the true faith«. It is leaving
the fellowship of darkness to be »with Christ, the true light«, for-
saking the false doctrine of Rome »for the doctrine of the gospel
and the apostles, and for Christ the head of the church«.83

Unity was a pastoral as well as a theological issue, as is evident
in Firm Foundation. Its extended title indicates that it was written
to inform and console simple Christians at a time when there were
many divisions and when scholars were in conflict. He argues that
Christ and the apostles prophesied discord in matters of the faith
and that there were divisions between the Roman and evangelical
churches and even among evangelicals, leading to the names Lu-
theran and Zwinglian.84 There were, however, disputes also in the
early church about the faith.85

Bullinger faces the challenge of those who hold that as God is a
God of peace and not of discord and as there is discord among
evangelicals, evangelicals are not a church and their teaching and
faith are false. Bullinger responds by distinguishing between »the
necessary chief points« of the faith and »the teaching and articles
on which people’s salvation does not primarily depend«. He holds

84 Firm Foundation, 1r, l. 11– 1v, l. 20. – Bullinger maintains that there are divisions

in the Roman churches, for example, between Thomists and Scotists (5r, l. 25–29).

85 Firm Foundation, 4r, l. 22 – 4v, l. 12. – Bullinger notes that Clement of Alexan-
dria records that Jews accused Christians of being divided and therefore wrong, where-
as Jews were united (4r, l. 22–27).

81

that all true believers are agreed on the chief articles or given a
little time will be.86 Bullinger employs a variety of defence from
analogies, such as the unity of a married couple who disagree on
some household matters. He outlines a series of divisions in the
New Testament, such as those between Paul and Peter, and Paul
and Barnabas, and those among Christians in Corinth; and also
divisions in the early church between many of the fathers.87 Bullin-
ger does not regard discord as good nor does he seek to defend it.88
He gives examples from the early church to offer consolation to
simple, godly people, who are troubled by the disputes among
theologians. He exhorts them to pray God to bring peace and
unity, as he did in the past. Besides praying, they should turn their
gaze away from the disputes and not let contradictory opinions
turn them from Christ.89

Images of the Church

In presenting particular doctrines, Bullinger often expounds some
of the biblical terms used of them.90 He does this with the church,
with images such as house, vine, and body.91 These images show
his high doctrine of the church in the intimate way they relate God
to the church. God builds the church, though he also uses people
to help in the building. Christ is its foundation, and also its cor-
nerstone. Perhaps most important is his maintaining that »just as a

86 Firm Foundation, 5v, l. 14 – 6r, l. 12.
87 Firm Foundation, 6v, l. 1 – 9v, l. 24.
88 In The Second Helvetic Confession, he adds the Pauline reason for dissension in
the church: »It pleases God to use dissensions in the church to the glory of his name, to
illustrate the truth, and so that those who are in the right may be manifest« (RB 2/2,
313.24–26; RC, 265).

89 Firm Foundation, 10r, l. 1 – 10v, l. 17.
90 Büsser, Die Stadt auf dem Berg, 31–32, draws attention to the medieval character
of Bullinger’s use of a variety of biblical images for the church. He observes that Calvin
used only two images of the church (as body of Christ and mother) compared with
Bullinger’s use of several.

91 Bullinger uses the word parable (HBTS 3, 785.10–13; Harding, vol. 4, 68). The
order of the images varies. In The Second Helvetic Confession, it is temple or house,
bride, flock, and body (RB 2/2, 311.23–312.2; RC, 263). In The Christian Religion, it is
sheepfold, body, bride, house, and pillar (99v, l. 2–29).

82

house is dwelt in by people, so God dwells in the church«.92 Some
of these images, such as the body, are directly related to Christ. But
some which are not as directly related to him, such as the house
and the temple are expounded in relation to Christ. Thus Christ is
the foundation of the house, and he is related to the temple as the
pillars upholding it and the entrance into it.93 The image of the
vine and branches abiding in each other is directly related to
Christ, as is that of the body, of which Christ is the head.94 The
body has its life from the head, and without the head the body is
dead. Moreover, the head is joined to the members through grace
and the Spirit. Through the Spirit he is always present, and so he
has no need of a vicar. »Where, therefore, a vicar of Christ is
acknowledged, no Christ is there, and therefore anti-Christ reigns
in that place.«95

The image of marriage has a similar force.96 In the union of
Christ and his church, which as a pure virgin, loves him alone,
there is a sharing. He takes believers’ weakness, sin, and death and
gives his justification, sanctification, and life, so that they may be

92 HBTS 3, 785.30–33, 786.5–6, 9, 787.28–29; Harding, vol. 4, 79–80, 82. – In
commenting on the kingdom of heaven in 3:1, Bullinger states, »For the church is the
house of the living God, the temple of the Holy Spirit, in which God lives and reigns.«
(Commentary on Matthew, 27r, l. 49–50).

93 HBTS 3, 786.9–787.12, 787.23–31; Harding, vol. 4, 80–83.
94 The figure of the body and head as well as that of the foundation of the church
are used against the Church of Rome and the role of the pope. Bullinger also contrasts
the papal view of »Roman monarchy« with Christ’s vision of servant leadership and his
refusal of a crown, supporting this with Jerome’s regarding bishops and elders as equal.
The image of shepherd and sheepfold points to Christ as the only shepherd of the
universal church. He commits to Peter ministry and not sovereignty and Peter reminds
his fellow elders that they are examples to the flock, not lords over it. Bullinger then
quotes Gregory’s rejection of the title of universal pastor, which belongs to Christ, but
which is claimed by the pope: »whoever calls himself universal priest is a forerunner of
anti-Christ«. (HBTS 3, 789.13–790.6, 790.20–792.10; Harding, vol. 4, 85–89).

95 HBTS 3, 788.36–789.1, 789.7–8, 11–16; Harding, vol. 4, 84–85.
96 Already in his Reply to Burchard, Bullinger uses the image of the church as the
bride of Christ (HBTS 2, 147.25–26). Selderhuis, Kirche, 520–523, emphasizes the
eschatological dimension in the presentation of the church in Sermons on the Apoca-
lypse. This is related of course to the text of the Apocalypse. In it the image of the
marriage of the church to Christ with the need for us to prepare to meet the bridegroom
gives an eschatalogical accent to Bullinger’s use of this image. Indeed our whole life is
spent preparing for this (Sermons on the Apocalypse, 252.32–34; English translation
565). The eschatological dimension is already present in The First Helvetic Confession,
related to Ephesians 5:27 (RB 1/2, 49.5–9; RC, 105).

just and holy and may live through him. Moreover, through the
union with Christ (and the seed of his word) the church as a
mother begets children. The church of Rome, by contrast with the
true church, receives and hands on a new teaching which is alien to
the word of God and begets many children, not to Christ but to
anti-Christ.97

Christ and the Church

Throughout his works, Bullinger emphasizes the inseparable link
between Christ and the church. Staedtke notes that this is charac-
teristic of the early Bullinger.98 It is at the heart of Bullinger’s cri-
tique of the teaching and practice of the Roman church. The
church is described as those who believe in Christ and those who
hear the shepherd’s voice (John 10:3). Christ is »the only head of
the church«, and therefore the church does not »need a vicar«,
which the Bishop of Rome claims to be. »Believers in Christ« are
called »a house of the living God« for »God dwells in their hearts
as in a house or temple«. It is Christ’s sacrificial death which
makes them priests. Twenty years later in The Decades, in ex-
pounding images of the church, he emphasizes that it is inseparable
from Christ. With the image of the body, he states, »Christ is never
separated from the church; nor does it live other than from Christ.
Although he is absent in body from the church, he is however most
present in the Spirit and in operation and government, so that he
needs no vicar on earth. He alone governs and remains for ever the
only head, the only king, the only priest and saviour of his
church.«99 There is a similar emphasis some twenty years after The
Decades in his commentary on Isaiah. In it Bullinger maintains

97 HBTS 3, 792.13–15, 30–36, 793.3–6, 16–19, 794.1–3; Harding, vol. 4, 90–92.
98 Staedtke, Die Theologie des jungen Bullinger, 216–220.
99 HBTS 3, 789.12–16; Harding, vol. 4, 85.– The intimate relation of Christ and the
church is evident in Firm Foundation in 1563. The chapter on the church begins with
Christ’s teaching as its only head, lord, shepherd, bridegroom, and ruler. The church is
the congregation of all believers, founded on Christ the rock. They are the sheep who
hear the shepherd’s voice. They are members of Christ and are content with his
teaching. Elsewhere it is said to have all fullness in Christ. (34v, l. 13 – 35v, l. 15, 13r,
l. 8–17).

that »That is the true church, the congregation or assembly of all
the faithful which rests on the foundation Christ, on whom alone it
depends as its head, to whom alone it listens and whom alone
it obeys in true faith, nor does it have any communion with
strangers.«100

Abstract: The church is central to, but not the centre of Heinrich Bullinger’s theology.
There is for him no salvation outside the church and salvation is itself ecclesial as well
as personal. The article considers the main contexts in which Bullinger expounds his
understanding of the church and the major areas of disagreement: scripture, salvation,
unity, and catholicity with his Roman and Anabaptist opponents, but also holiness with
Anabaptists. The issues involved in these areas differ according to the context, for
example, with Roman opponents the authority of scripture over and against that of the
church, but with Anabaptists the authority of the Old Testament alongside the New. In
his exposition of the outward marks of the church, Bullinger mostly points to word and
sacrament, through which Christ establishes the church, although the emphasis is on the
word. He also mentions other marks, such as suffering. The inward marks are the Holy
Spirit, faith, and love. Characteristically, Bullinger draws on a range of biblical passages
in his exposition, including the various biblical images of the church, but with his
Roman opponents he also adduces the support of the fathers.
