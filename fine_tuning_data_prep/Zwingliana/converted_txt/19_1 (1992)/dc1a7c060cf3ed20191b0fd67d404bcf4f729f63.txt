Christian  Discipline, Church  and  State, and 

Toleration:  Bullinger, Calvin, and  Basel 

1530-1555 

by  J.  WAYNE BAKER 

The  recently  published  book,  «Heinrich  Bullinger,  Vater  der  reformierten  Kir(cid:173)
che»1, serves to remind us that Bullinger was in many ways the father  of the Re-
formed  churches.  His legacy  lives  on even  today  in covenant  theology  and  fed-
eral  political  philosophy2,  and  in  a variety  of  other  ways  in  churches  that  trace 
their  origins  to  sixteenth-century  Switzerland.  This  study,  however,  focuses  on 
areas  in  which  Bullinger  had  little  lasting  impact -  church  discipline, the  rela-
tionship of the church to the civil government, and toleration -,  and how Bullin(cid:173)
ger  and  Calvin  related  to  each  other  on  these  topics,  especially  in  connection 
with Basel. 

Bullinger 's Position  in 1531 

Bullinger  first  clearly  articulated  his position  on discipline  and  the  relationship 
of  the church  to the civil  Community3  in  a letter  to Berchtold  Haller  of  Bern  in 
July  15314.  He made his position  crystal  clear  at  the outset:  «I see  excommuni(cid:173)
cation  to be nothing  other  than  the public  and  Christian  guarding  of  public  vir(cid:173)
tue  and  Christian  morals».  He  thus  defined  excommunication  broadly  to  mean 
simply  Christian  discipline.  Bullinger  then  turned  to  the  question  of  who  con-
trolled  such  discipline:  excommunication,  or  «the  power  of  punishing  crimes 
and the guarding of virtue  ... is committed  to the magistrate». The magistrate, as 
the minister of  God (Rom.  13), had been commanded  to guard the good  and de-
stroy the evil  in the Christian  Community5.

Bullinger  also  considered  the  method  of  excommunication  or  Christian 
discipline  in his letter to Haller. To those who argued that to treat a person  «as a 
heathen»  (Matt.  18:17) meant to exclude the offender  from  the fellowship  of the 
church, he replied, «in all such things Christ  only  wished that he should be pub-
licly  punished  who  decided  to  live  dishonorably  after  he  had  ignored  friendly 
warnings.»  To  be  «a  heathen  and  a  publican»  was  to  be  counted  among  the 
criminals  and  to be punished  as  such. The  offender  should  first  be  warned  by a 
close  friend,  and  then  by  two  or  three  others.  If  he  was  still  recalcitrant,  he 
should  be  called  before  the  overseers  of  excommunication,  that  is  before  the 
magistrate. If this final  warning  was ignored,  «let him pay the penalty. And this 
(according  to  the  word  of  the  Lord)  is  the  method  and  limit  of  excommunica(cid:173)
tion:  punishment,  I  say,  proclaimed  and  paid»6.  Bullinger's  position  was  un-
equivocal:  excommunication,  which  consisted  of  public  punishment  for  public 
offences,  was the responsibility  of the magistrate. 

Bullinger then argued against the ban from  the eucharist. The purpose  of the 
eucharist  was  to  console  sinners.  The  goal  of  excommunication  was  to  con-
strain  the  evil  example;  it  was  not  to  be  employed  for  the  purification  of  the 
church.  Therefore,  since  excommunication  and  the  eucharist  had  separate  and 
distinct  functions,  they  should  not  be  connected  with  each  other.  Once  the  ma(cid:173)
gistrate  had  inflicted  his punishment,  the  offender  had  paid  his penalty  in  füll7. 
This,  in brief  summary,  was Bullinger's  position  as he  expressed  it  to  Haller  in 
mid-1531. 

Bullinger's  letter  to  Haller  brought  about  one  of  his  first  connections  with 
Basel,  when  Haller  sent  Bullinger's  letter  to Oecolampadius,  the  chief  pastor  at 
Basel,  for  his  reaction8.  When  Oecolampadius  wrote  back  to  Haller,  he  reacted 
harshly to Bullinger's position. Oecolampadius  interpreted Matthew  18:15-17 to 
mean  that  the  offender  should  be  warned  and  admonished,  and  if  necessary, 
excluded  from  fellowship  and from  the eucharist. Punishment  by  the  magistrate 
was a penalty in addition  to, and separate from,  excommunication9. 

Oecolampadius  feit  that  those,  like  Bullinger,  who  rejected  the  use  of  the 
ban  did  not  understand  either  the  purpose  of  the  eucharist  or  the  nature  of  the 
church.  It  was true that  the eucharist  was for  sinners, but  it  was  not  for  the  en-
emies of Christ.  It served unity, peace, love, and purity  in the church; and  those 
who  refused  tu  use  the  ban  «hold  the  church  for  nothing  and  do  not  desire  to

increase its holiness.» That was the purpose  of excommunication  -  the  holiness 
of  the  church.  Toward  the  end  of  the  letter,  he  Struck  out  at  Bullinger:  How 
could  anyone be  so  ignorant  of philology  that  «he  does  not  know  what  excom(cid:173)
munication  is?» Why deny the ban when  it was used  in the ancient church?  The 
ban had  been  given  by  Christ  to guard  against  shameless  sinners  in  the  church, 
but Bullinger wanted to open the door to those very sinners!10 

While  there  were  thus  two  competing  theories  about  Christian  discipline 
within  Reformed  Protestantism  by  1531, there  was  only  one  System  in  Opera(cid:173)
tion.  All  the major  Reformed  cities  in  the  Swiss  Confederation  were  «Zwingli-
an» in  terms  of  civil  control  of  the church  and  the clergy.  Each  had  a  Marriage 
Court and, if excommunication  was to be used  at all, it was exercised  under  the 
watchful  eye of the civil  magistracy. 

Bullinger's  Contacts  with Basel,  1531-1550 

Late  in  1531, Bullinger accepted  the  invitation  of  the Zürich  Council  to replace 
Zwingli  as the  leader  of  the  Zürich  church.  During  the  next  twenty  years,  Bul(cid:173)
linger  had  close  relations  with  the  Basel  church.  Two  matters  of  importance 
during that period  illustrate how Bullinger got along with the Basel pastors. 

The First Helvetic  Confession 

A  number  of  pastors  from  the  Swiss  Reformed  churches  and  from  Strasbourg 
assembled  at Basel  in January  1536 with the intention  of drawing  up a  common 
confession  of faith.  Bullinger and Oswald Myconius, the new head pastor at Ba(cid:173)
sel,  were the  chief  authors  of  the First  Helvetic  Confession,  adopted  by  the  de(cid:173)
legates  on  February  4th.  There  is  no hint  in  the  Confession  that  there  was  any 
disagreement  on  the  matter  of  Christian  discipline  -  it  was  to be  controlled  by 
the Christian magistracy, the civil  government11. 

At  the  same  time  that  Bullinger  was  writing  the  Confession,  a  young 
Frenchman  by the name of John  Calvin  was living  in  Basel.  He  wrote  and pub-
lished the first  edition of his «Institutes»  in Basel in  1536. During the year or so 
that  he  lived  in  Basel, he  became  acquainted  with  the  ideas  of  Oecolampadius 
on  church  discipline  and  became  his  most  important  disciple.  It  is  not  known 
whether he  met  Bullinger  or  any  of  the  other  delegates  who  approved  the  First 
Helvetic Confession  in January.

The  Consensus  Tigurinus 

Toward  the  end  of  this  twenty-year  period,  another  confession  of  sorts  brought 
Bullinger  and  Calvin  together,  and  involved  the  Basel  church.  After  two  years 
of  negotiations,  Bullinger  and  Calvin  had  finally  been  able  to  make  an  agree-
ment  on  the  Eucharist,  the  «Consensus  Tigurinus»  of  1549.  The  «Consensus» 
was  both  a  unifying  and  a  divisive  document.  It  was  unifying  in  that  it  unified 
Zürich  and  Geneva  on  this  crucial  doctrine  of  the  Eucharist.  But  it  was  also  di(cid:173)
visive  because  it  was  not  accepted  by  all  the  Swiss  churches.  The  Bernese  did 
not  agree  to  the  «Consensus»,  and  the  Basel  church  also  refused  to  accept  it, 
apparently  because  it was  not  consulted  about  the  agreement12. 

Basel's  reaction  to  the  Consensus  may  have  been  due  in  part  to  the  fact  that 
a  certain  antipathy  had  been  growing  between  Calvin  and  the  Basel  pastors  and 
humanists  in  the  1540s13,  and  in  fact  there  also  seems  to  have  been  a  cooling 
between  Basel  and  Zürich  in  the  late  1540s.  Therefore,  while  Bullinger  came 
closer  to  Calvin  with  «Consensus»,  he  began  to  draw  away  from  the  Baslers  at 
the  same  time.  This  would  become  more  apparent  during  the  controversies  in 
Geneva  in  the  early  1550s  -  the  Bolsec  controversy  over  predestination,  the 
discipline  conflict,  the  Servetus  Affair,  and  the  Toleration  Controversy.  Though 
Bullinger  fully  agreed  with  the  Baslers  concerning  Bolsec  and  predestination, 
he  agreed  with  Calvin  and  drew  closer  to  him  when  it  came  to  Servetus  and  tol(cid:173)
eration. 

Bolsec  and  the  Controversy  over 

Predestination 

In  October  of  1551,  Jerome  Bolsec  publicly  denounced  Calvin's  teaching  on 
predestination.  He  claimed  that  it  was  unbiblical  and  heretical,  and  that  it  made 
God  the  author  of  sin.  Bolsec  was  arrested  and  tried  for  heresy.  He  appealed  to 
the  judgment  of  the  churches  of  Bern,  Basel  and  Zürich,  and  the  Genevan 
Council  agreed  to  request  the  advice  of  these  churches.  The  replies  of  these 
churches  called  for  moderation  and  reconciliation.  None  of 
totally 
supported  Calvin's  position,  and  generally  they  were  more  favorable  to  Bolsec 
than  to  Calvin14.

The letters from  Bullinger are particularly  interesting  and important.  Bullin-
ger  clearly  disagreed  with  Calvin,  while  not  openly  agreeing  with  Bolsec.  Bul(cid:173)
linger expressed  his own mild  doctrine  of  Single predestination,  and  he  refused 
to  endorse  Calvin's  harsher  doctrine  of  election  and  reprobation.  He  informed 
Calvin  that  many  people  were  offended  by  his  doctrine,  and  that  they  inferred 
from  it that Calvin made God the author of  sin15. 

Calvin  was stung by this  criticism;  he  clearly  feit  unfriendly  toward  Bullin(cid:173)

ger because of his lack of Support and criticism. He complained  to Farel that the 
Zürichers  had  been  rüde  in  their  official  letters  and  that  Bullinger  himself 
«haughtily  despises our necessities.»  Among  other  things  he  wrote  to  Bullinger 
that it was «extremely  absurd» to defend  Bolsec16. It was more than a year  later, 
in April  1553, that the two men repaired  their  friendship17. 

Calvin  also  complained  bitterly  about  the  Basel  pastors'  response.  In  their 
letter  to  the  ministers  of  Geneva  in  November  1552,  they  practically  agreed 
with  Bolsec,  giving  precedence  to  faith,  rather  than  election,  in  the  matter  of 
justification18.  Calvin  denounced  Myconius  for  being  cold  and  indecisive,  and 
he  criticized  Simon  Sulzer  and  the  other  pastors  at  Basel  for  failing  to  support 
him19.  The  Basel  pastors  thus  had  no  more  sympathy  for  Calvin's  position 
against Bolsec than Bullinger had20. 

In late  1551 and early  1552, then, Bullinger  and the Basel pastors were  unit-
ed  in  their  Opposition  to  Calvin's  teaching  on  predestination,  although  no  one 
was willing  to  defend  Bolsec  himself.  Soon,  however,  an  occasion  would  arise 
that  brought  Bullinger  to Calvin's  defense.  The  Servetus  Affair  was the  solvent 
that  dissolved  the  bonds  between  Bullinger  and  the  Baslers.  In  fact,  at  the  cli-
max  of  Calvin's  long  battle  over  discipline  at  Geneva,  Bullinger  even  defended 
Calvin's  viewpoint  on  Christian  discipline,  the  point  of  view  that  Calvin  had 
learned  from  Oecolampadius  and  Bucer. It  was not  that  Bullinger  was  convinc-
ed  by  Calvin  -  he  continued  to  oppose  any  sort  of  independent  church  disci-

pline -,  but he feit  that  Calvin was beset  by enemies  who wished  to  destroy  the 
Reformation  in Geneva. Those enemies included  the «radical» humanists  of  Ba(cid:173)
sel  who  totally  disagreed  with  Calvin's  treatment  of  Servetus  and  initiated  the 
Toleration  Controversy  in  1554. 

The Discipline  Conflict and the Servetus  Affair 

The Servetus  affair  began  in  Geneva  on  August  14th,  1553, when  Servetus  was 
imprisoned.  It ended on October 27th with his execution. The discipline  conflict 
came  to  a  head  in  early  September  and  was  concluded  in  mid-December.  The 
discipline conflict,  which had begun years prior to  1553, puts the Servetus  affair 
within its proper  framework. 

The Discipline  Conflict 

The conflict  between  Calvin  and the Council  over who controlled  Christian  dis(cid:173)
cipline  in  Geneva  had  begun  in  the  early  1540s.  In  the  late  1540s  and  early 
1550s,  Calvin's  opponents  were  led  by  Ami  Perrin.  This  conflict  entered  its 
most crucial  stage in February  1553 when the Perrinist faction  came to power in 
the yearly  elections.  They  feit  that  the  time  was  ripe  for  a  serious  challenge  of 
Calvin.  Their  attack  was  direct:  they  denied  that  the  Consistory  had  the  power 
to excommunicate. Philibert  Berthelier,  one  of  Calvin's  most  stubborn  enemies, 
had been excommunicated  by the Consistory  in  1551 for publicly  stating  that he 
was «just  as good  a man  as Calvin.»  His excommunication  had  been  repeatedly 
renewed  because of his rebellious attitude and his refusal  to accept the  authority 
of  the  Consistory.  In  early  September  1553  the  Council  annulled  his  ex(cid:173)
communication  and allowed  him to communicate  if  he wished  to do  so,  despite 
Calvin's vehement protests21. 

The  Servetus  case  must  be  viewed  within  the  larger  framework  of  Calvin's 
continuing  conflict  with  the  Perrinist  faction  in  Geneva.  In  fact,  the  argument 
has been made that  Servetus counted  on  the aid of  Calvin's  enemies, or  conver-
sely  that  the  Perrinists  meant  to  use  the  Servetus  Affair  to  discredit  Calvin22. 
Calvin  himself  certainly  saw  a  connection  between  the  manner  in  which  the 
Council handled the Servetus case and its enmity toward him23. 

Registres Geneve I  147; II: 48-49; Register  (Hughes), pp. 205, 285-286. 
For  a treatment  of  these  arguments,  See Roland  H.  Bainton,  Hunted  Heretic,  the  Life 
and  Death  of  Michael  Servetus,  1511-1553, Boston  1960,  [abbr.:  Bainton,  Servetus], 
pp.  172-181. 
He wrote to Bullinger on September 7,  1553,  that the Genevan Council  would  write to 
him  for  his judgment  of  Servetus.  «Even  with  our  loud  protests  they  give  you  this 

40 

Others presumed  a connection  between the Servetus  case  and  Calvin's  other 
problems in Geneva. Bullinger  wrote to Johannes Haller at Bern: «I believe that 
he  [Servetus]  fled  to  Geneva  by  the  providence  of  God  so  that  she  [Geneva] 
might  cleanse  herseif  from  the  Charge  of  blasphemy  and  heresy  among  many 
people by  giving  him  a deserving  punishment.  But  I  hear  that  they  [the  Perrin-
ists]  actually  protect  that  most  good-for-nothing  fellow  out  of  hatred  for  Cal(cid:173)
vin»24.  Wolfgang  Musculus  wrote  to  Bullinger  from  Bern  that  Servetus  hoped 
«to make füll  use of the ill-will  with which the magnates  there attack  Calvin»25. 
Haller  wrote  to  Bullinger  that  dissension  and  bitterness  was  increasing  at  Ge(cid:173)
neva, and that Calvin's enemies were trying to destroy him because of  «the rigor 
of the ecclesiastical  discipline  that has  been  established  there... It  is  oppressive 
and intolerable to those who are  powerful...»26. 

At  the  height  of  the  Servetus  case,  then,  the  long  conflict  at  Geneva  over 

discipline  was entering  its final  and most crucial  stage. The two issues, the  Ser(cid:173)
vetus trial  and the crisis  over discipline, were closely  intertwined.  The  Perrinist 
faction  maneuvered  in  the  background  to  attempt  to  get  an  acquittal  for  Ser(cid:173)
vetus.  Perrin  himself  argued  for  a  verdict  of  not  guilty27.  Calvin  claimed  that 
Perrin  had  even  attempted  to  secure  Servetus'  release  after  he  had  been  found 
guilty28.  The  majority  on  the  Council  knew,  however,  that  Servetus  had  to  be 
dealt with  severely, especially  considering that the Swiss churches  unanimously 
agreed on such a punishment29. He was executed  on October 27th. 

This  was  the  context,  then,  in  which  the  Council  lifted  Berthelier's  excom-
munication  in early  September.  The pastors  protested  the  Council's  action,  and 
requested  that  the  magistrates  follow  the  «Ecclesiastical  Ordinances».  The 
councilmen  answered  that  they  were  following  the  «Ordinances»,  that  the 
«Ordinances»  had  never  given  the  Consistory  the  power  of  excommunciation, 
and that  this  authority  resided  in  the  Council  alone. After  a  few  weeks  of  con-
tinuing  disagreement,  and  one  month  after  the  execution  of  Servetus,  the 
Council  wrote  to  the  Councils  of  Bern,  Basel,  Zürich  and  Schaffhausen  to  ask 
their opinions about discipline and  excommunciation30. 

The reply  from  Bern  was  short  and  to  the  point:  in  Bern  there  was  no  ex-
communication31. The reply  from  Basel has a more complex  history. The  actual 

annoyance, but they have come to such madness and rage that everything  we say to 
them is suspected.» CO 14, 611; Bonnet II 427.

Situation  at  Basel  was  similar  to  that  in  Zürich  and  Bern.  Oecolampadius'  plan 
had never really been implemented;  Basel had never had  anything  like  Geneva's 
Consistory.  The  magistrates  were,  in  essence,  in  control  of  excommunication 
and  it  was  not  often  used.  Christian  discipline  in  Basel  was  Community 
discipline  in  the  hands  of  the  civil  authorities,  more  or  less  along  the  lines  of 
Bullinger's  theory. 

What,  then,  was Basel's  response  to the  Genevan  Council's  request32  for  its 
opinion  on the  matter  of  a church  court  exercising  the power  of  excommunica(cid:173)
tion? Sulzer wrote two letters to Calvin and the Genevan pastors. His first  letter, 
of  December  21st,  discovered  only  recently33,  was  never  sent  to  Calvin,  but  it 
throws a totally  different  light on the letter that he wrote  and  sent to Calvin two 
days later, on December  23rd34. 

In  the  first  letter,  Sulzer  bragged  to  Calvin  that  Basel  had  a  harsher  disci(cid:173)

pline than Geneva because in Basel the offender  was excluded not only from  the 
Eucharist  but  also from  the civil  Community.  Sulzer explained  that  the  offender 
was  warned  three  times  by  the  ecclesiastical  judges  (censores,  Bannherren), 
then,  a fourth  time  by  the  Council.  If  he  continued  in  disobedience,  the judges 
of  the  church  excommunicated  him.  Sulzer  portrayed  the  Council's  role  as 
simply  one  of  support  and  protection  of  the  process,  so  that  the  offenders 
«might  understand  that  the  magistrate  approves  of  the  ecclesiastical  laws.»  He 
wanted  Calvin  to understand  that  the ecclesiastical judges, not  the  Council,  ex(cid:173)
communicated  the  offender35. 

The true purpose  of  the fourth  warning  by  the  Council  was, however,  quite 
different  from  Sulzer's  interpretation.  It  gave  the Council  the  right  to  supervise 
ecclesiastical  discipline. If there was doubt about that  in anyone's mind, the Ba(cid:173)
sel  Council  decided  two  days  after  Sulzer's  first  letter  to  Calvin,  on  December 
23,  to clarify  the Ordinance. According  to the «Clarification»  (Erläuterung),  the 
Council must punish the offender  with fines,  imprisonment,  or exile if he ignor-
ed  the  fourth  warning  from  the  Council.  Or  the  Council  could  «order»  the  ec(cid:173)
clesiastical judges  to  punish  the  offender  «with  the  ban»;  but  the  ecclesiastical 
judges  could  not  exercise  excommunication  without  such  a command  from  the

magistrate36.  There could be no doubt now. All  discipline,  including  excommu-
nication,  was  in  the  hands  of  the  magistrate.  This  was  precisely  what  the  Ge-
nevan  Council  wished 
to  have  —  total  control  of  Christian  discipline, 
Community discipline rather than church discipline. 

On the same day, December 23, Sulzer wrote the second letter to Calvin, but 
now  his  Interpretation  and  the  tone  were  quite  different  from  two  days  earlier. 
Rather  than  boasting  of  a  pure  church  discipline  at  Basel,  Sulzer  now  wished 
that  «a  genuine  discipline»  might  be  established  in  the  Basel  church37.  The 
altered  tone  of  his  second  letter  probably  reflects  a  small  controversy  in  Basel 
over the issue of discipline between  the 21 st and the 23rd of  December. 

Sulzer led the church  party  in  this  controversy,  the party  that  advocated  the 
sort  of  church  discipline  that  Sulzer  described  in  his  first  letter  to  Calvin.  The 
other party, which favored  the Zwinglian  type  of  discipline,  was  led  by  Bonifa-
cius  Amerbach,  a  Consultant  to  the  Council,  and  included  other  enemies  of 
Calvin  such  as  Castellio.  Though  the  details  of  this  controversy  in  1553  are 
unknown,  Amerbach  had  led  an  earlier  fight,  in  the  1530s,  to  subordinate  the 
church  to  the  Basel  government38.  In  any  case,  the  Council  settled  whatever 
controversy  still existed with the «Clarification»  of December 23. 

Though  the  Basel  Council's  own  letter  to  the  Council  at  Geneva  was  non-
commital,  favoring  neither  party,  the  Council  enclosed  a  copy  of  the  Basel 
Discipline Ordinance, and the recent «Clarification»39.  There could now be little 
confusion  about the viewpoint  of the Basel magistrates. 

The most  interesting  feplies  came from  Zürich.  Surely  the Perrinists  in  Ge(cid:173)
neva  expected  support  from  the Zürich  magistrates. But  they  did not  know  that 
Calvin  had  secretly  written  to Bullinger  and the  pastors  in Zürich,  pleading  for 
their  support  against  that  «godless  faction»  of  men  «who  were  not  ashamed 
noisily  to  defend  the  cause  of  Servetus.»  His  opponents,  the  Perrinists,  were 
attempting  to overthrow  true religion  and  godly  discipline. The aid  of  the Züri(cid:173)
chers  had  been  crucial  in  the  Servetus  case.  But  the  battle  was  not  over.  The 
same  «evil  men»  who  defended  Servetus  wished  to  destroy  the  Reformed 
church  in  Geneva.  So the Zürich  pastors  had  to  persuade  the  Council  in  Zürich 
to give the correct reply to the Council in Geneva40. 

Astonishingly,  Bullinger  complied  with  Calvin's  request,  despite  his  own 
aversion  to the idea of an ecclesiastical  court  with  a Jurisdiction  independent  of

the magistrate. In a letter of December  12, Bullinger made it clear to Calvin  that 
he  had  gone  to  a  considerable  amount  of  trouble  to  avert  an  unfavorable  reply 
from  the  Zürich  Council41.  The  Zürich  Council  suggested  in  its  letter  that  the 
Genevans  should  retain  their  present  System  even  though  it  differed  from  Zu-
rich's42, thus assuring Calvin's victory in the Discipline  Controversy. 

Why  did  Bullinger  go  against  all  his  principles  and  beliefs  on  Christian 
discipline  to  support  Calvin  in  this  controversy?  In  part  because  Calvin  had 
convinced  him  that  the  same  Perrinist  party  that  had  attempted  to  protect  Ser-
vetus  was  now  attempting  to  silence  the  gospel  in  Geneva.  I  suspect  however, 
that  it  also  may  have  been  due  in  part  to  the  Baslers'  reaction  to  the  Servetus 
crisis. 

The Servetus  Crisis 

Calvin received  the füll  support  of  Bullinger  and the Zürich  pastors  in the  mat(cid:173)
ter  of  Servetus.  The  Zürich  pastors  wrote:  «We  judge  that  one  should  work 
against  him  with  great  faith  and diligence,  especially  since  our  churches  are  ill 
spoken-of  abroad as if they were heretical  and supporters  of heretics. God's holy 
providence  has  presented  this  opportunity  whereby  you  may  at  the  same  time 
purge both yourselves  and us from  this perverse  suspicion of evil»43. 

Though  the  Basel  ministers  said  that  they  agreed  with  the Zürichers44,  their 
reply  did  not  please  Calvin  entirely.  As  he  put  it,  «The  Baslers  were  prudent. 
The  Zürichers  were  the  most  vehement  of  all»45.  All  the  Swiss  Reformed 
churches  agreed  that  Servetus  was a heretic  and must be punished.  None of  the 
official  Swiss replies  to the Genevans expressed  any doubts  about the issue, but 
there  were  some  individuals  who had  doubts, even  among  those  who  basically 
agreed with Calvin. 

More than six weeks prior to Servetus' execution, Calvin complained  to Sul(cid:173)

zer about  lack  of  support  from  some of  the Baslers46.  Three weeks  later,  Sulzer 
wrote  to Bullinger  that  there  were those who  were  quite  upset  by  the  tactics  of 
Calvin  and  the  Genevan  Council  toward  Servetus47.  On  October  14,  Vergerio 
wrote  to  Bullinger,  «A  friend  writes  to  me  from  Basel  that  Servetus  does  not

lack supporters there»48. One week before  the execution,  Philip Gallitius  report-
ed to Bullinger  that  a refugee  scholar from  Italy,  whom  Gallitius did  not  name, 
supported  the  cause  of  Servetus49.  Then,  after  Servetus'  execution,  the  human-
ists at Basel attacked  Calvin  vehemently. 

Criticism  was  widespread  enough  that  Calvin  published  a  defense  of  the 
treatment  of Servetus early in  1554, in his «Defense  of the Orthodox  Faith». On 
December 30, Calvin wrote Bullinger that his book against Servetus would  soon 
be  published,  and  that  he  intended  to  include  Bullinger's  (i.e.,  the  Zürich  pas-
tors')  letter50  about  Servetus  if  Bullinger  did  not  object.  In  the  same  letter,  he 
complained  about those men at Basel,  the radical  humanists, who had  protested 
so loudly against the execution  of Servetus51. 

All this was happening  during  the Discipline  Controversy  in  November  and 
December  1553. It seems  quite possible,  in the light  of  these reports  of  support 
for  Servetus,  that  Bullinger  feit  compelled  to come  to Calvin's  aid  on  Christian 
discipline  in  order  to  strengthen  the  forces  of  good  and  godliness  against  the 
forces  of evil. Despite their differences  on the necessity  of  a Consistory  for  pur-
poses  of  Christian  discipline,  Calvin  and  Bullinger  were  of  one  mind  when  it 
came to Servetus: it was absurd to consider tolerating  someone  who  threatened 
the stability  and existence of the Christian  community -  such heretics  should be 
put to death. 

In his «Defense  of the Orthodox  Faith», published  early  in  1554, Calvin  di(cid:173)
rectly  addressed  the question,  «Whether  Christian judges  are permitted  to  pun-
ish  heretics».  His  answer  was  unequivocal  -  it  was  the  magistrate's  God-given 
duty  to  put  heretics  and  blasphemers  to  death.  Significantly,  Calvin's  biblical 
justification  came  from  Deuteronomy  13, which  commands  that  false  prophets 
be put to death32. 

In April, Calvin  reminded  Bullinger  that  he had  encouraged  Calvin  to  write 
the «Defense».  Some might  portray  him  as  a «master  of  ferocity  and  atrocity», 
who now  «defames  with  a pen  the  dead  man  who perished  at my  hands.»  And 
there  were  others  who  were less  critical  but  wished  that  Calvin  had  never  dealt 
with  the  question  of  punishing  heretics.  «But»,  he  went  on  to  Bullinger,  «it  is 
well  that  I have  you  as the partner  in my  fault,  if  indeed  there  is  fault,  because 
you advised  me  and encouraged  me  to do it. Therefore,  prepare yourself  for  the 
struggle»53.  It appears, then,  that  Bullinger  had  been  an  instigator  in  encourag-

ing  Calvin  to  write the  «Defense».  That  fits  not  only  with  what  we know  about 
Bullinger's  attitude toward  Servetus, but  also with his beliefs  about  how to  deal 
with  heretics.  Since  the  early  1530s,  Bullinger  had  advocated  that  it  was  the 
magistrate's  duty  to  execute  heretics54.  There  is  no  evidence  that  he  ever 
changed  his  mind.  This  letter  also  demonstrates  how  far  Bullinger  had  been 
pulled into Calvin's web by the Servetus Affair,  which resulted  in a loosening of 
the ties  between  Bullinger  and  the  Baslers.  Inasmuch  as  the  Baslers  were  most 
critical of Calvin's treatment of  Servetus and of his «Defense»,  it was  inevitable 
that there would be a certain estrangement between Bullinger and Basel. 

The Toleration  Controversy,  1554-1555 

The reaction  from  Basel  was  not  absolutely  uniform.  Sulzer,  who  was now  the 
chief  pastor  of  the  Basel  church,  wrote  to  Bullinger  and praised  Calvin's  opin-
ions  on  punishing  heretics  as  expressed  in  the  «Defense»55.  But  there  was  a 
crescendo  of  criticism  from  the  humanists  in  Basel56.  The  most  eloquent  re(cid:173)
sponse came from  Sebastian  Castellio. 

Calvin  and  Castellio  had  known  each  other  for  several  years. Castellio  had 
become  Calvin's close friend  in Strasbourg  in  1540, and then  Calvin's  colleague 
in  Geneva  from  1541  to  154457. When  Castellio  was  denied  Ordination  in  1544 
because  of  disagreements  with  Calvin58,  he  left  Geneva  for  Basel,  where  he 
spent  several  years  as  a  poor  scholar.  Then,  in  1553, he  became  Professor  of 
Greek  at  the  University  of  Basel.  In  March  of  1554,  under  the  pseudonym  of 
Martinus  Bellius, he  published  a book  with  the  title  «Whether  Heretics  Should 
Be Persecuted»  (De haereticis  an sint persequendi»). He included  long  passages 
defending  religious  toleration  from  Erasmus,  several  Protestant  reformers, 
including Luther,  Castellio himself,  and quotations  from  several church  fathers.

56  There  were also some  outside of Basel  who did not  agree  entirely  with Calvin's  argu-
ment in the «Defense». For instance, Nikolaus Zurkinden, Chancellor of Bern, wrote to 
Calvin  on  February  10,  1554, that  even  though  he  detested  the  errors  of  Servetus,  he 
disagreed  with Calvin about  using capital punishment  for heresy. The use of the sword 
had been futile  with the Anabaptists, and it would be no more useful  to employ  it now.

Even  Calvin  appeared  in two  short  quotations.  Although  Castellio  did  not  even 
mention  the  execution  of  Servetus  in  the  book,  no  one  doubted  the  connec-
tions59. 

Late  in  March,  Calvin  wrote  to  Bullinger,  «a  book  has  recently  been  pub-
lished  in  Basel  under  false  names,  in  which  Castellio  and  N.  [Curione]  argue 
that  heretics  should  not  be  coerced  by  the  sword.»  Then  Calvin  expressed  the 
wish that the pastors at Basel would  finally  act responsibly  and prevent that evil 
opinion from  spreading  further60. 

Theodore Beza also wrote to Bullinger, guessing correctly that Castellio  was 
the  author  of  the  book61.  In  August,  Beza  published  a  refutation  of  Castellio's 
«Whether  Heretics  Should  Be Persecuted».  Beza's  book,  entitled  «Whether  He(cid:173)
retics Should  Be Punished  by the Civil  Magistrate»  («De haereticis  a civili  ma-
gistratu  puniendis»),  argued  that  it  was  the  duty  of  the  magistrate  to  punish 
heresy,  even  to death. This response  precipitated  a  long, bitter battle  in the Re-
formed  churches over the issue of toleration. 

It  is  evident  that  Calvin  and  Beza  held  a  certain  enmity  toward  Basel,  an 
enmity  and  estrangement 
that  was  intensified  by  Castellio's  defense  of 
toleration  and  by  the  chorus  of  criticism  from  the  Basel  humanists.  Clearly, 
Bullinger  also  was  estranged.  When  Castellio  died,  ten  years  after  the  con-
troversy, Bullinger  wrote, «The best  thing has happened:  Castellio  of  Basel  has 
died»62. It is significant  that he phrased  it, «Castellio of Basel». 

Conclusion 

Bullinger  and  Calvin  continued  to  agree  on  the  Eucharist  and  worked  toward 
universal  approval  of the «Consensus»  in the Swiss Reformed  churches.  Bullin(cid:173)
ger  and  Calvin,  and  then  Bullinger  and  Beza,  also  agreed  on  the  treatment  of 
heretics. If heretics were not punished, the entire Christian Community would be

tainted  and  ruined.  And  they  even  agreed  that  it  was  the  Christian  magistrate 
who must  punish  heretics. So they  spoke  with  one voice  on  the  topic  of  tolera-
tion.  But  they  did  not  agree  on  church  discipline  and  the  relationship  of  the 
church to the civil  government  within  the Christian  Community.  Though  Calvin 
had won his battle over discipline  in Geneva with the help of Bullinger  in 1553, 
he and Beza had to fight  the battle  again  in the Pays de Vaud later in the  1550s, 
and it would again flare  up  in the late  1560s  in  Heidelberg  after  Calvin's  death. 
Bullinger  was  in  the  forefront,  fighting  for  the  magisterial  discipline  in  which 
he  believed,  but  it  was  a  battle  that  the  Calvinists  would  eventually  win  in  the 
Reformed  churches.
