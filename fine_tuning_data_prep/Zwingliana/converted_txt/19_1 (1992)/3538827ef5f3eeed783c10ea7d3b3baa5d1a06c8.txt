The Place of Predestination  in Zwingli  and 

Bucer 

by  WILLIAM PETER  STEPHENS 

In both Zwingli and Bucer there is a strong sense of the sovereignty of God and of 
his  initiative  in our  salvation.  Yet there  are  some  significant  differences  between 
them  in the ways in which they  express God's  sovereignty  and in which it  shapes 
their thought. This can be seen in particular  in the different  place that the doctrine 
of predestination has in their theology. 

For  Zwingli  predestination  was  not  developed  until  1526,  and  even  then  it 
remained  subordinate  to  his  doctrine  of  providence  and  his  general  stress  on  the 
sovereignty  of  God.  For  Bucer,  however,  it  was  developed  earlier,  in  1524,  and 
helped to give a particular  shape to his theology. In this context it is interesting  to 
note that they emphasised  different  texts in their discussion  of predestination. For 
Bucer  it was  Romans  8:28-30,  a text with limited  importance  for  Zwingli.  It had 
from  the  first  a  vital  role  in  Bucer's  understanding  of  predestination  and  also  an 
important  bearing  on the way  predestination  affected  other  parts  of  his  theology. 
For Zwingli  the  emphasis  was rather  on Romans  9,  and  a verse  such  as  Romans 
9:21. 

As Zwingli  paid  less  attention  to predestination,  it is helpful  first  to  focus  on 
his  doctrine  of  providence,  which  he  sees  as  the  mother  of  predestination,  and 
then to examine both the context and  the various  ways in which he used predesti(cid:173)
nation in the five years between  1526 and his death in 1531. 

With  Bucer  our  main  concern  is  also  with  five  years,  from  1524  to  1529, 
though  there  is  some reference  to other  works. His  later  works  do not differ  sub-
stantially  from  his earlier ones, even though he treats the subject more extensively 
and  systematically  in  his  commentary  on  Romans  in  1536  than  elsewhere1.  We 
will  consider  his  early  exposition  of  predestination,  with  particular  reference  to 
Romans  8:28-30,  and  some of  the  ways  in which  this  affects  his  theology,  diffe-
rentiating  it from  Zwingli's. The presentation  of  Bucer calls  into question,  though 
for the most part implicitly, the position expounded by August  Lang. 

A number of issues raised by predestination  are not discussed here. I have dealt with 
some of them in: William Peter Stephens,  The Holy Spirit in the Theology of Martin 
Bucer, Cambridge 1970 [abbr.: Stephens, Holy Spirit],

Predestination  is  not  a  fundamental  element  in  Zwingli's  theology2.  Indeed  it 
hardly  features  in  his  theology  until  1526  when  he  used  it  as  an  argument  in  his 
discussion  of  original  sin.  This  is  surprising,  as  it  is  a  matter  which  had  engaged 
his  mind  for  several  years. 

There  is  evidence  that  Zwingli  had  grappled  with  predestination  in his  reading 
of  the  fathers,  the  schoolmen,  and  contemporary  writers.  In  his  marginal  notes  he 
marked  the  discussion  in  Origen  and  the  distinction  between  foreknowledge  and 
predestination  in  the  fathers3.  His  study  of  Aquinas  led  to  his  recollection,  albeit 
inaccurate,  in  «The  Providence  of  God»  of  what  Aquinas  had  said  on  foreknow(cid:173)
ledge4.  He  had  also  read  -  probably  in  1516 -  Eck's  semi-Pelagian  «Chrysopassus 
seu  VI  Centuriae  de  praedestinatione»5.  Moreover  Myconius  wrote  a  letter  to  him 
on  11  July  1521  which  raised  the  issue  of  free  will,  the  view  of  some  that  it  did 
not  matter  how  they  lived  if  they  were  elect  (or  alternatively  not  elect),  and  the 
Charge  of  injustice  made  against  God.  Myconius  knew  what  had  been  said  by  Paul 
in Romans  9,  by  Augustine  and  Jerome  against  the  Pelagians,  and  by  Ambrose,  to 
whom  he  ascribed  «De  vocatione  gentium».  What  he  wanted  to  know  was 
Zwingli's  view6. 

Zwingli  used  terms  such  as  «elect»  in  his  early  works,  but  he  did  not  develop 
a  doctrine  of  predestination,  nor  did  he  relate  predestination  to  other  issues.  His 
references  were  sometimes  little  more  than  a repetition  of  the  biblical  text7.  How-
ever  his  early  writings  have  a  strong  sense -  both  personal  and  theological  -  of  the 
sovereignty  and  providence  of  God.  This  is  expressed  in  personal  terms  in  «The 
Plague  Song»  (with  its  «Thy  vessel  am  I;  To  make  or  break  altogether»)  and  his 
letter  to  Myconius  in  July  1520  (with  its  «I  beseech  Christ...  that  he  break  me  as  a 
potter's  vessel  or make  me  strong  as  it pleases  him»)8.  In  both  of  these  he  is  allud-
ing  to  Romans  9:21. His  references  are  significantly  to  Romans  9,  not  Romans  8. 
(Indeed  when  he  refers  to  Romans  8  it  is  usually  to  verses  31-32  rather  than

28-30, the text which was so important for Bucer.) He affirmed  the sovereignty of 
God  in his repeated  use of texts such  as John 6:44 and 45. This fits  his later com-
ment on the impact of Paul, John, and Augustine on him9. 

Alongside  or  within  his  stress  on  the  sovereignty  of  God,  which  informs  the 
whole of theology, is his understanding  of the providence of God. In «An Exposi(cid:173)
tion  of  the Articles»  this doctrine  is used to attack  any  notion  of works, merit, or 
free  will.  The  main  discussion  is  in  the  exposition  of  article  20.  Zwingli  uses 
Matthew  10:28-31,  one  of  his  favourite  texts  in  discussing  providence,  to  show 
that everything happens because God has ordained it, even the falling  of a sparrow 
to the ground. Then,  he argues, if that  is the case, how much more are our  works 
ordained by God10. 

In this  context Zwingli  deals with  objections  to God's justice  if  he  condemns 
us for  not  being  good  when  he  has  not  made  us  good.  He  appeals  to  Romans  9: 
«Therefore  he  disposes  of  his  vessels,  that  is  to  say  us  men,  as  he  wills.  He 
chooses (erwellet) one to be fit  for his purposes and use; the other he does not will 
to choose. He can make his creatures whole or break them, as he wills.» Although 
Zwingli  deals  with  a text  that  implies  election  and  reprobation,  he  does  not  deal 
with the question of predestination  but rather the question of God's sovereignty or 
providence. Free will is dismissed,  for  it does not acknowledge  God's providence, 
but ascribes to us what in fact God has done in us11. 

Zwingli  draws on a ränge of biblical texts to show  that God is the cause of all 
things, and states that his excursus on providence was to show that it is not we but 
God  who  effects  what  is  good  in  us  and  that  we  are  simply  instruments  through 
whom he works12. 

In  «A Commentary»  in  1525 Zwingli  discusses providence  in the  sections on 
God  and  merit13.  If  in the  first  he  is more  concerned  with  the  created  world, ne-
vertheless  the close  relation  with  free  will  and  merit  is manifest.  «For  the  whole 
business  of  predestination,  free  will,  and  merit  rests  upon  this  matter  of  provi(cid:173)
dence»14.  In  the  section  on  merit  he  continues  to  wrestle  with  some  of  the Pro(cid:173)
blems  relating  to  providence,  in  particular  the  idea  that  God  may  be  seen  as  the 
author of evil.

For  Zwingli  «the  whole  Scripture  of  the  Old  Testament  views  everything  as 
done by  the providence  of  God»15. He argues  for  the  sovereignty  and  providence 
of God on biblical grounds  and with biblical  support, drawing on a ränge  of texts 
from  the New Testament  and the Old. However,  these texts are not concerned es-
sentially  with  predestination,  which  in  any  case  is  seen  in  the  context  of  provi(cid:173)
dence, which is itself described as «the mother of predestination»16. 

Concern  with  the  sovereignty  and  providence  of  God  are  manifest  in  «The 
Providence of God» in  1530. It is an expansion of his sermon at Marburg in  1529. 
In  this  much  more  philosophical  discussion  of  the  subject,  a  discussion  which 
draws heavily  on non-biblical writers, predestination  is but one chapter. However, 
some of the problems which are raised by predestination  are dealt with here in the 
context  of providence, in which God  is seen  as the cause  of  all things  in creation 
and redemption. This view rejects  the role of  anything creaturely  in our  salvation, 
not  only  the role  of  works  or merit  but  also  that  of  Word  and  sacrament,  and of 
course Chance. However,  in «St Matthew» Zwingli States that belief  in providence 
does not  lead  to indolence  in the elect. The Spirit  of God  is unceasingly  active in 
them in doing good, for God uses them as instruments to effect  his will17. 

It was  in  1526 that predestination  first  had  a clear role in Zwingli's  theology. 
In the second  part of  «Original  Sin» he answers  the question  whether original  sin 
condemns  all people  to death:  «The bliss  of  everlasting  life  and the pain  of  ever-
lasting  death  are  altogether  matters  of  free  election  or  rejection  by  the  divine 
will».  Salvation  is  not  attached  to  baptism  or  circumcision,  but  comes  «to  those 
elected of God» before they were born. Christ did not say, «He that is not baptized 
is damned». Zwingli's  concern  is to show  that  salvation  comes from  election, not 
from  participating  in the  sacraments18.  For Zwingli, Anabaptists, just  as much  as 
papists,  think  salvation  is  tied  to  Symbols  and  do  not  see  the  free  election  of 
God1». 

«Original  Sin»  was  addressed  to  Urbanus  Rhegius,  who  wrote  to Zwingli  on 
28  September  on the  questions  of  universalism  and  the necessity  of  faith  for  sal(cid:173)
vation. «We know  that  no one can be saved unless he  is in  Christ. We judge  that 
no  one  can  be  grafted  into  Christ  without  faith»20.  In  1523 Zwingli  had  himself 
related  salvation  to faith  and,  as Urbanus Rhegius  did  in his letter,  had  used He-
brews  11:6  and  Mark  16:15-16  in  a  discussion  of  purgatory  to  show  that  those

who died without faith  were condemned21.  He argues here, however,  as he was to 
argue  with  the  Anabaptists  against  their  stress  on  faith,  that  the  passages  do  not 
apply  to children, but  only  to those  who hear  the Word. He affirms  both the role 
of Christ and the role of election, for the elect are drawn through Christ  alone, but 
it is only the elect who come to Christ. The difference  between  adults and children 
comes out also in the matter of  signs of election. Faith (or elsewhere the love and 
fear of God) is a sign of election, but its absence in children is not a sign that they 
will be damned22. 

Zwingli  developed  his  use  of  election  in his  defence  of  infant  baptism  in «A 
Refutation»  in  1527,  when  it  seems  to  have  been  the  Anabaptists  rather  than 
Zwingli  who introduced  the question  of  election. Against  the ascription  of  salva-
tion to  faith,  Zwingli  points  to the fact  that election  lies behind  faith,  referring  to 
Romans  8:29-30:  «And  those  whom  he  predestined  he  also  called;  and  those 
whom  he called  he also justified;  and  those  whom  he justified  he also  glorified». 
By the  use  of  synecdoche  Zwingli  argues that  attributing  salvation  to  faith  is the 
same as attributing it to election and calling which precede it23. 

The Anabaptist  use of Romans  9:11-13, with its reference  to Jacob and  Esau, 
Zwingli turned to his advantage by arguing first  that only the elect are members of 
God's people, but  the  elect  include  those  who, like infants,  do not yet believe. A 
person  may  be  elect,  although  he  does  not  yet  believe.  Therefore  he  argued  that 
the text,  «He who does not  believe  will be condemned»,  much  used by  Anabap(cid:173)
tists, concerns  neither those  not old enough  to hear nor those  to whom  the gospel 
has  not  been  preached.  The  children  of  Christian  parents  are  in  the  covenant  of 
Abraham  and  that  makes  us  sure  of  their  election,  until  there  is  contrary  evi-
dence24. Faith is the fruit  and evidence  of election;  yet Zwingli can  allow that we 
make  mistakes  in  our judgment  about  people's  faith,  as  the  apostles  did  with  Si(cid:173)
mon Magus25. 

Zwingli  had  earlier  wrestled  with  the  extent  of  election  and  argued  that  it  is 
not limited  to Israel. This is related to God's sovereignty  and his election. His ac-
tion outside Israel, as his speaking through  sibyl prophetesses, is intended to allow 
us  to  «recognise  the  liberty  of  his  will  and  the  authority  of  his  election»26.  (In a 
letter to Blarer on 4 May  1528 he was to relate this to God's election, but also to 
the Spirit's creating not just Palestine but the whole world. He adds that God nou-
rishes  godliness  among  the  elect  wherever  they  are27.)  God's  acting  outside  his

denied». Z VIA 184, 2-4; The Selected Works of Huldrych Zwingli, ed. by Samuel Ma-

people raises the question of the relation of that action to Christ -  not that Zwingli 
intends to sever election  from  Christ, as the elect are destined  to be saved through 
him. Nevertheless  Zwingli  can  say that election  is «above  baptism,  circumcision, 
faith, and preaching»28. 

In «The Providence of God» Zwingli discusses predestination in chapter 6. He 
prefers  the word election  to predestination  and places it in God's goodness, which 
includes his righteousness  and mercy. Zwingli adduces Exodus 7:3-4, 9:16,  33:19 
and Romans  9:18  to show that election  comes from  God's will  (and is not depen-
dent on his foreseeing  how we shall act) and Romans 9:9-12 and  11:6 to show that 
it has  nothing  to do  with  our  work  or merit29.  The discussion  raises  various  que-
stions:  the  relation  of  the  election  of  the  Gentiles  to  Christ  and  to  the  means  of 
grace, the signs of election, and sin in the elect. 

The  sense  of  God's  sovereignty  and  freedom  in election  is expressed  in rela(cid:173)
tion  to  the  Gentiles  and  to the  outward  means  of Word  and  sacrament.  The  free(cid:173)
dom  of  God's  election  is the basis  of  God's  activity  among  the Gentiles.  (This  is 
also related, as in the early Zwingli, to Paul's words about the Gentiles in Romans 
2:14-1530.)  This  sovereign  freedom  raises  the  question  of  the need  for  Word  and 
sacrament for those who come to faith.  In this context he uses  1 Corinthians  3:6-7 
to indicate the limitations of the outward word, which (he says) scripture and daily 
experience  show  us,  does  not  bear  fruit  of  itself31.  In  «The  Resurrection  and 
Ascension  of  Christ»  he  relates  salvation  and  eternal  life  to  election  and  asserts 
that God is able to save the Gentiles  through  Christ even if the outward  gospel of 
Christ is not preached to fhem32. 

In the  light of  Romans  8:30  Zwingli  sees  faith  and  love, or the lack of  them, 
as a  sign  to us  whether  or not  others  are  elect.  (Nevertheless  Zwingli  recognised 
that hypocrites do many outwardly good works without faith,  and therefore  he de-
nied  that  faith  is present  simply  because  works  are  present33.)  However  as  some 
people do not respond as soon as the gospel is preached, we should pass judgment 
only on those  «who persist  in unbelief  until  death»34. In keeping  with «A  Refuta(cid:173)
tion», the death of the children  of Christian  parents  is «a sign of divine election», 
just as faith is in adults35. 

However  this  does  not  mean  that  the elect  do not  sin. They  do, but  they  rise 
again, as did David, Paul, and Mary Magdalene. However to indulge one's inclina-

tions  thinking  one is safe  because  one is elect  is evidence  that  one is not elect  or 
that one does not yet have faith  or the knowledge of God36. 

Yet  Zwingli  is not  fundamentally  concerned  to  show  that  we  can  know  our-
selves or others to be elect because of our or their faith  or works, which is the em-
phasis in Zeller31. 

In «An Account of the Faith» Zwingli discusses election in the third, fifth,  and 
sixth articles on Christ, redemption, and, the church, and to a certain extent the se-
cond article  on God. In the third he relates election  to Christ and roots it in God's 
righteousness  as  well  as  his  goodness.  In  the  tenth  article  there  is  a  passing, 
though  important,  reference  to  election  in  connection  with  the  preaching  of  the 
Word.  Although  faith  comes  from  the  Spirit  alone, it is nevertheless preceded  by 
outward  preaching.  Zwingli  adds  that  the  sending  of  preachers  of  the  Word  to a 
place is a sign of God's grace, that he wishes to manifest  knowledge of himself  to 
his elect38. 

In  the  fifth  article  he relates  the  salvation  of  the  children  of  Gentiles  both  to 
the  redemption  wrought  by  Christ,  the  second  Adam,  which  matches  the  ruin 
wrought  by  the  first  Adam,  and  to  God's  free  election  which  precedes  faith.  He 
also argues  in terms  of  Christ  that the children  of  Christian  parents belong  to the 
church  as did the children  of Jewish  parents  in the  Old Testament  and  «that they 
no less than their parents are of the number of those whom we judge elect»39. 

In the  sixth  article  he defines  the church  as the elect  known  only  to God, but 
adds that only those who have faith  «know that they themselves are elect... but are 
ignorant  about  members  other  than  themselves».  They  know  because  they  have 
the seal of the Spirit who teils them that God is their Father and they call him Fa-
ther.  He adds that many  are elect who have not come to this faith.  He  also  states 
that the church  in the  sense of  all who are  called  Christians  is  sometimes  spoken 
of  as  elect,  even  though  one  cannot  know  that  they  are  all  elect,  any  more  than 
Peter could when he referred  to the elect in  1 Peter  1:140. 

In  the  commentaries  there  are  also  references  to judging  others  by  the  pre-
sence or absence of faith  or works of love, but usually  there is the reservation  that 
we  unlike  God judge  only  by  appearances41.  However,  the context  should  be no-
ted, and  it is often  a concern  to  show  that  faith  or works  depend  on  election  and 
flow  from  it. 

Throughout  Zwingli's  writings  there  are  references  to  the  church  in  terms  of 
election  or  faith,  although  there  are  naturally  more  references  to  it  in  terms  of 
election  in  the  later  Zwingli,  after  he  had  developed  his  doctrine  of  election  and

found  its  usefulness  in  debate  with  Catholics  and  Anabaptists.  Yet  even  in  the 
later  Zwingli  there  are  occasions,  as  in  «An  Exposition  of  the  Faith»,  where  the 
church  is  spoken  of  first  in  terms  of  believers,  as  it  is  also  spoken  of  as elect  in  the 
early  Zwingli42. 

However  the  doctrine  of  election,  which  strengthens  Zwingli's  understanding 
of  the  church  as  mixed  and  as  including  infants,  raises  a  problem  for  him  in  rela-
tion  to  excommunication.  He  deals  with  this  in  «St  Matthew»  in  relation  to  Mat(cid:173)
thew  18:18  where  God  is  said  to  bind  what  we  have  bound.  Zwingli  argues  that 
the  church's  judgment  does  not  affect  election.  If  the  person  who  is  punished  by 
the  church  is  elect,  he  will  repent,  and  therefore  he  is  not  handed  over  to  Satan,  as 
seems  to  be  stated  in  1 Corinthians  5:5.  Only  those  who  are  not  elect  are  handed 
over  to  Satan43. 

The  doctrine  of  election  lies  behind  the  vision  of  heaven  in  «An  Exposition  of 
the Faith»  which  so  scandalised  Luther.  It  includes  Socrates  alongside  Samuel  and 
Hercules  alongside  Hezekiah.  The  vision  is  not  directly  related  to  election,  but  it 
would  be  in  keeping  with  his  position  that  only  the  elect  will  enjoy  eternal  life. 
They  are  described  in  terms  of  faith  or  goodness,  but  that  for  Zwingli  would  have 
been  a  sign  of  election,  not  a  condition  for  it44.  Indeed  Zwingli  points  out  else-
where  of  pagans  who  have  done  outwardly  good  works  that  «their  works  were  not 
pleasing  to  God  because  they  lacked  faith»45. 

The  only  work  in  which  election  is  particularly  prominent  is  «Questions  Con-
cerning  the  Sacrament  of  Baptism».  Zwingli  replies  to  forty-six  questions  raised 
by  Schwenckfeld  about  baptism.  He  begins  by  offering  a  number  of  propositions 
which  largely  concern  election  and  states  that  they  cut  all  the  knots  in  the  whole 
of  religion.  Yet  the  use  of  election  is  essentially  negative.  It  is  not  the  basis  of 
Zwingli's  case  for  infant  baptism,  but  a  weapon  against  the  Anabaptist  linking  of 
baptism  and  faith  in  support  of  believers'  baptism.  It  is  election  which  saves. 
However,  we  cannot  know  who  is  elect  among  those  enrolled  in  Christ's  Service, 
and  the church  itself  consists  of  the reprobate  as well  as the  elect46. 

Predestination  has  a  subordinate  role  in  Zwingli's  theology.  Even  when  it  is 
developed  from  1526  and  is  used  in  controversy,  especially  with  Anabaptists,  it  is

46  Z VI/IV 30,  19; 33, 4-5; 34,  17-19. Zwingli  makes four  points  in the eighteenth propo-
sition.  First, we cannot  know  who  are elect  and  who  reprobate,  therefore  the  Anabap(cid:173)
tists  are  wrong  to  drive  out  from  the  church  the  children  of  Christians,  to  whom  be-
longs God's promise. Second, those who do not have faith  are not thereby  damned,  for 
faith  follows  election, not election faith.  Third, if only those who have faith  and repent 
should  be  baptised,  then  nobody  can  be  baptised,  for  we  cannot  know  for  certain  of 
people's faith. Fourth, the church includes elect members, both children and adults, and 
false  members, both children  and adults, and unbelievers, both those who  will  one day 
believe and those who will not (Z VI/IV 38, 9 -  39, 8). 

400 

often  used to affirm  or deny  Statements which Zwingli  has earlier affirmed  or de-
nied on some other basis such as faith  or God's sovereignty or providence. 

Thus providence  is used  in «An Exposition  of the Articles»  to deny  free  will, 

works, and merit, which are later denied on the grounds of predestination. 

There  are some matters the early Zwingli relates  to faith  which he later  links 
to election. For example, signs of faith  in the early Zwingli are parallel to signs of 
election  in  the  later  Zwingli.  In  his  early  writings  Zwingli  says  that  the  believer 
knows  that  he  is  drawn  by  God  (John  6:44)  if  he  believes  in  Christ47.  In  the  se-
cond  disputation  he  was  not prepared  to judge  who  was  damned,  but  left  that  to 
God48.  Yet he  also  states that  you  can recognise  an  unbeliever,  as either he does 
no good work or if he does he ascribes  it to himself  and  not to God. He adds that 
God wills to make such a person  a vessel of  wrath49. These matters  are later rela(cid:173)
ted to election. 

There  is also a parallel  to  the question  of  sin in  Christians  which  in his  early 
writings  Zwingli  discussed  in terms  of  believers  and  in  his  later  ones  in terms of 
election. In the early  Zwingli  God protects  those  who trust  in him, so that  if they 
fall  they  are  not  harmed  by  the  fall.  He  gives  the  examples  of  David  and  Peter 
who  were  led  to repent  and  reform50.  This  is  later  related  to  election  and  not  to 
faith. 

In  his  early  works  Zwingli  related  the  living  of  the  new  life  of  love  to  faith, 
something which he later related in part to election51. Furthermore the faith  or sal-
vation  of  the Gentiles  which  is later related  to election,  as in  «The Providence of 
God»,  is  earlier  set  in  other  contexts,  for  example  in  relation  to  sacrifice  (Mal 
1:11)  and the law of nature (Rom 2:14)52. 

According  to  the early  Zwingli,  in the exposition  of  the  sixty-seventh  article, 
the  salvation  of  the  children  of  Christian  parents  is  not  made  to  depend  on bap-
tism53.  (This  seems  to  imply  doubts  about  the  traditional  doctrine  of  original  sin 
and  the relation  of  baptism  to it.) This  issue  is, however,  dealt  with  explicitly  in 
terms of election in «Original Sin» in 1526. 

Moreover  some  of  the  theological  issues  raised  by  predestination  are  dealt 
with  in the early Zwingli  in relation  to the sovereignty  or providence  of God: the 
problem  of  human  freedom  and  that  of  God's justice  in  condemning  people  for 
things about which they can do nothing.

2. 

When  one  moves  from  Zwingli  to  Bucer,  one  is  Struck  by  the  difference  in  the 
place  of  predestination  in  their  theology.  For  Zwingli  it  is  a  sub-section  of  the 
doctrine  of  providence,  which  it never  replaces  in  importance.  For  Bucer  it  has  an 
important  place  in  his  theology  from  an  early  stage.  It  was  developed  through  the 
years  and  expounded  systematically  in  his  commentary  on  Romans,  published  in 
1536.  However  -  in  contrast  to  Längs 
study  of  Bucer's  doctrine  of  predestina(cid:173)
tion -  we  shall  concentrate  on  its origins  and  early  development  in the  twenties. 

Predestination  in  Bucer  was  discussed  at  length  by  August  Lang 

in  «Der 
Evangelienkommentar  Martin  Butzers  und  die  Grundzüge  seiner  Theologie»54.  A 
third  of  this  book  deals  directly  with  what  he  sees  as  the fundamental  principles  of 
Bucer's  theology:  the  sovereignty  of God  and  election. 

For  Lang,  Bucer  moves  from  an  assertion  of  the  sovereignty  of  God  in  the 
earlier  period  to  a  developed  doctrine  of  election.  Lang  recognises  that  there  are 
references  to  the  elect  and  the  reprobate  in  the  twenties,  but  he  sees  a  change  in 
the  thirties.  He  argues  that  Bucer's  earlier  references  to  election  and  reprobation 
Start  not  with  God's  action  but  with  human  behaviour.  Moreover  the  terms  elect 
and  reprobate  indicate  two  classes  of  people:  saved  and  lost,  believer  and  unbelie-
ver,  godly  and  ungodly.  For  Lang  the  terms  are  ethical  rather  than  religious  and 
dogmatic55.

The  change,  seen  in  the  commentary  on  Romans  in  1536,  shows  Bucer  en-
gaging systematically  and theologically  with the issues involved in the doctrine of 
election, in particular in relation to the doctrine of God. In this later stage election 
is  linked  with  a  positive  view  of  the  means  which  God  uses  (Word  and  sacra-
ment). Lang  contrasts  this  with  an earlier  emphasis  on  the  sovereignty  of  God  in 
the Spirit, in which moreover the Spirit is not related to the means of grace and is 
not really thought of religiously56. 

Längs  discussion  of election, though extensive, is not comprehensive. It rests 
largely  on  the  commentaries,  especially  the  three  editions  of  the  commentary  on 
the  gospels  and  the  commentary  on  Romans,  with  some  references  to  the  com(cid:173)
mentary  on  Ephesians.  He  offers  an  explanation  more  ingenious  that  convincing 
for  any  reference  in  the  later  works  of  Bucer  which  he  has  omitted  and  which 
might  not  fit  his  Interpretation57.  However,  it  is  the  omissions  in  and  interpreta-
tions of the early Bucer which most distort Längs  presentation. A particularly  im-
portant Omission is Bucer's  reply to Treger in  1524, which -  with other writings  -
suggests  a different  view from  Lang's  of the place of predestination  in Bucer  and 
in particular shows some of the differences  between him and Zwingli. 

First,  however,  we  may  note  a  use  of  predestination  which  is  common  to 
Zwingli  and  Bucer  and  the  other  reformers.  It  is  used  negatively  to  deny  that 
works play any part in our salvation and positively  to affirm  that our salvation de-
pends  wholly  on God's  free  election.  This  is one role of  predestination  in  Bucer, 
not least  in Opposition  to Catholic  and  Anabaptist  opponents. Thus, for  example, 
he  states  in «St  Matthew»  that God's  election  of his  sons is «from  the  foundation 
of  the  world,  before  they  had  done  good  or  evil»58.  According  to  «Ephesians», 
election  means  that  «everything  depends  on  the free  election  of  God»  and not on 
merit or free  will or anything eise59. 

Yet this view is not the only important emphasis in Bucer. There are two main 
emphases which relate to the crucial role of Romans  8:28-30  in his theology. The 
text  has  a restrictive  and  a  forward  reference.  It  is  restrictive  in  that  only  those 
who  are  predestined  will  be  called  or justified  or  glorified,  but  it  also  has  a  for(cid:173)
ward  reference  in that  all those  who are predestined  will  also be called,  justified, 
and glorified.  The first  of  these affects  Bucer's  understanding  of  Word  and  sacra-
ment,  and  excludes  the  possibility  that  they  can  be  the  automatic  bearers  of  the 
Spirit  and grace  of God  to all  who receive  them. The  second  implies  a necessary 
link  between  things  which  are  often  separated,  such  as  faith  and  love,  imputed 
righteousness and real righteousness, the new birth and the new  life.

There  are  references  to  predestination  in  Bucer's  earliest  writings,  when  he 
speaks  of  the  elect  and  the  reprobate  and  also  of  vessels  of  wrath  (Rom  9:21)60. 
However  the  first  significant  use  of  predestination  occurred  in  1524.  The  context 
was  the  controversy  with  Treger,  an  Augustinian  who  was  later  to  appear  at  the 
Berne  disputation.  Treger  argued  on  the basis  of  Galatians  3  that  all  who  are  bap(cid:173)
tised  have  put  on  Christ.  This  position  Bucer  rejected  by  reference  to Romans  8.  It 
is  notable  that  he  refers  to  Romans  8:28-30,  a  passage  which  was  to  be  especially 
important  in  shaping  his  understanding  of  predestination  and  which  in many  ways 
distinguishes  his  approach  from  Zwingli's. 

Bucer  argued  that  Galatians  3  applies  to  those  who  believe  in  Christ,  saying 
that  «not  all  those  baptised  can  be  meant,  but  only  those  called  according  to  God's 
purpose,  foreknown  and  foreordained,  to  be  conformed  to  the  image  of  his  Son.... 
For  he  speaks  of  the baptism  in which  one  puts  on  Christ,  is  Christ's,  and  abides  in 
him....  That  is  what  the  baptism  of  Christ  does,  for  he  baptises  in  Spirit  and  fire 
and  not  in  water  alone,  like  John  the  Baptist.  Those  who  receive  only  the  sacra-
ment  of  baptism,  and  yet  are  foreknown  to  be  damned,  are  not  inwardly  baptised 
in  the  Spirit  by  Christ,  for  they  will  not  be  glorified  and  therefore  they  are  not  ju-
stified  by  Christ»61.  There  is  here  a  distinction,  but  not  necessarily  a  Separation 
between  baptism  in water  and  baptism  in  the  Spirit.  The reprobate  receive  only  the 
former,  the  elect  the latter  as  well. 

The  same  distinction  is  made  in  the  «Grund  und  Ursach»,  where  Bucer  chal-
lenges  the  belief  that  baptism  in  itself  saves  a  child  and  that  without  it  he  will  not 
see  God's  face.  Bucer  contrasts  baptism  by  the  Spirit  with  water  baptism,  but  he 
does  not  separate  them.  Baptism  can  be  said  to  be  effective  for  those  who  believe 
in  one  place  and  for  the  elect  in  another62.  «For  the  forgiveness  of  sins  is  the  bap(cid:173)
tism  of  Christ,  which  he  works  in the  elect  through  his  Holy  Spirit».  However  it  is 
not  the  outward  baptism  which  saves.  «The  Lord  certainly  says, <He  who  believes 
and  is  baptised  will  be  saved,  but  he  who  does  not  believe  will  be  damned>.  But 
he  does  not  say,  <He  who  is  not  baptised  will  be  damnedx  For  God  does  not  bind 
his  grace  to  water»63. 

God  does  not  bind  his  grace  to  water  in  the  sense  that  he  must  give  his  grace 
to  everyone  with  it  and  does  not  give  it  to  anyone  apart  from  it.  For  Bucer  the 
water  of  baptism  is  nothing  in  itself.  It  is  an  instrument  or  vehicle  of  the  Spirit 
only  when  the  Spirit  uses  it.  For  Bucer,  however,  with  infants  as  well  as  with 
adults  the  condition  of  its  effectiveness  is  election.  In  arguing  for  infant  baptism 
on  the  basis  of  God's  care  for  us  from  our  mother's  womb  he  says:  «Even  if  we 
baptise  a  few  goats  [that  is,  those  who  are  not  sheep  and  therefore  not  elect],

whom  Christ  does  not  will  to baptise  with  his  Spirit,  it is  only  a  matter  of  so  much 
water  and  prayer.  Likewise  the  apostles  did  not  always  succeed  in  baptising  only 
believers»64. 

This  positive  (or relatively  positive)  linking  of  baptism  and  election  persists  in 
the  commentaries  in  the  twenties.  Thus  in  «St  Matthew»  he  states  that  the  ascrip-
tion  of  saving  power  to  baptism,  which  is  «a  work  of  man»,  is  a  denial  of  justifi-
cation  by  faith65.  Nevertheless  in  the  situations  for  which  God  has  appointed  bap(cid:173)
tism  he  baptises  with  the  Spirit  -  that  is  with  those  who  are  elect  and  those  who 
have  faith66. 

Bucer  rejects  the  Lutheran  view  that  infants  can  have  faith  as  that  would  in-
volve  hearing  the  gospel  and  being  persuaded  of  it.  But  he  holds  that  if  they  are 
elect  they  will  have  the  Holy  Spirit, just  as  John  the  Baptist  did,  who  was  füll  of 
the  Holy  Spirit  from  his  infancy.  At  the  appointed  time  they  will  be  led  to  faith  in 
the Word  of  God«. 

In  the  twenties  Bucer's  main  concern  was  the  Catholic  (and  according  to  Bu-
cer's  understanding  of  it,  the  Lutheran)  error  of  making  the  sacrament  an  automat-
ic  instrument  of  the  Spirit68.  In  «Getrewe  Warnung»  he  attacks  the  view  «that  it 
cleanses  children  from  all  sins... that,  as  soon  as  one  baptises  them,  Christ  imparts 
to  them  his  Spirit...  or  that  by  virtue  of  the  word  <I  baptise  thee  e t o,  the  Holy 
Spirit  comes  into  the  water  and  is  communicated  to  the  baptised  children...»69. 
Bucer  gives  various  reasons  for  rejecting  this  view,  among  which  is  that  it  ignores 
the  doctrine  of  election.  Thus  he  relates  the  effectiveness  of  baptism  to  election 
and  does  not  sharply  separate,  although  he  distinguishes,  the  sign  and  what  it  si-
gnifies. 

The  way  Bucer  relates  predestination  to  baptism  is  similar  to  the  way  he  rela(cid:173)
tes  it  to  the  Word  and  the  eucharist.  Like  Zwingli  he  has  a  strong  sense  of  the  so-
vereignty  of  God  and  the  need  for  people  to  be  taught  of  God.  In  his  sovereignty 
God  does  not  need  outward  means, but  for  Bucer  that  does  not  mean  that  he  does 
not  use  them.  In  «Grund  und  Ursach»  Bucer  states  «Christ  can  convert  whom  he 
will,  without  my  preaching,  but  he  wishes  to  use  my  ministry  in  doing  so,  as  well 
with  deeds  as  with  words»70.  So  it  was  with  Cornelius  and  Paul:  «the  former  had 
to  be  subject  to  Peter,  the  latter  to  Ananias,  as  teacher»71.  Yet  this  use  of  a  prea-

There  is  a more  positive  emphasis  in the  later  Bucer  which  can  be  seen  in  the  use of 
analogy  and biblical texts. In «Apologia»  of  1526 he rejects  the idea that baptism  is an 
instrument  of salvation, like herbs for the body  (A  12.B.7-14). But in «De vi et usu» he 
compares  the  sacraments  with  effective  remedies  for  sickness  (TA  598.11-25).  In  the 
twenties  Bucer  Stresses in  1 Corinthians  3 that  it is God  who gives the  increase, in the 
thirties that it is to what we plant and water that God gives the increase.

eher or teacher does not deny the fact,  as the example of the Magi shows, that God 
knows his own (that is, the elect) and «can teach them about himself, even without 
outward preaching»72. 

There is, however,  in «St Matthew»  a clearer association  of the inward teach-
ing of the Holy  Spirit with the doctrine  of election. «For in the case of adults it is 
necessary  that  the  gospel  be  preached  first,  after  which,  if  they  are  among  the 
sheep  [that  is, the  elect],  they  are  given  the  Spirit,  so that  they  have  faith  in  the 
gospel...»73. 

In  «Ephesians»  there  is  a greater  stress  on  the  view  that  the  Word  is  not  an 
automatic  vehicle  of  the  Spirit74.  However,  in  his  controversy  with  the  Anabap-
tists, he describes those who attack the public preaching  of the Word  as led by an 
evil  spirit  precisely  because  it is  by  the preaching  of  the Word  that  the  elect  are 
led to faith  in Christ75.  Indeed God may be said to penetrate the hearts of the elect 
through his Word, of which he persuades them by his Spirit76. 

The Spirit  is also  said to be at work  in the elect before  the Word  is preached, 

both  positively  and  negatively.  Negatively,  he  makes  them  weary  and  heavy  la(cid:173)
den,  without  rest  or  peace,  because  they  do  not  please  God.  They  come  to  the 
Lord  when  he  calls  them77.  The  Spirit's  work  can  also  be  expressed  positively. 
«His prineipal  work, in fact,  is to make  us inquisitive  about and understanding  of 
divine things, which the natural man neither cares about nor is able to reeeive. The 
result  is that  we thirst  for  the Word  of God,  and  that,  when we have heard  it, we 
reeeive it...»78. 

Bucer  repudiates  Luther's  view  that  the  Spirit  comes  only  through  Word  and 
sacrament  by  reference  to  the  examples  of  Paul  and  Cornelius,  John  the  Baptist 
and  the Ethiopian  eunuch. The  Spirit  is  «the  seed  of  God,  of  whom  the elect  are 
never destitute, since indeed they are separated from  their mother's  womb, as Paul 
also was». By contrast, the Word is preached  to the reprobate so that they may be 
blinded™. 

Bucer's  conviction  that  only  the  elect  reeeive  applies  to  the  eucharist  as  to 
baptism. In  1526 he states in «Apologia» that the Spirit is sent to the elect and that 
where he is present people eat and drink to eternal life80.  By contrast, the impious

but also the view that he cannot act apart from  them. «Baptism  with  water is not in 
itself  necessary  for  salvation,  so that  no one can be  saved  without  it» (72.B.22-26; 
25.A.3-5;622.D.10-13).

139.B.3-27; 50.A.12-27;  682.C.3. This  is  dropped  in  1536. In  «Romans»  there  is a 
clearer sense of the Spirit's working alongside the Word, rather than before the Word. 
80  He  also  links  reeeiving  «the  body  of  Christ  with  the  bread»  to  faith  (A  19.B.26-

20.A.1). 

406 

(that  is, the reprobate)  cannot  eat  the body  of  Christ,  because  «Whoever  eats my 
flesh  and  drinks  my  blood  abides  in me  and  I  in him,  and  he has  eternal  life»81. 
This  Statement foreshadows  his eventual  agreement  with the Lutherans, where he 
distinguishes the impious from  the unworthy. The former  are reprobate and cannot 
receive Christ's  body, the latter can  as they  are elect. The unworthy  include those 
who have different  degrees of faith and those who for a period lapse. 

The way Bucer uses Romans  8:28-30  in «Against Treger» has a forward  refe-
rence, as well as a restrictive one. It is not just that people's justification  and glori-
fication  depend  on  their  election82.  Their  election  also  leads  to  their  «being  con-
formed»  to the image of Christ, for that is the purpose of their election83. The elect 
may fall, yet they  never fall  from  the gracious hand of God, but are led by him to 
attain the measure of the stature of the fullness  of Christ84. 

In  «Ephesians»  there  is  a  clear  sequence,  but  it  is  a  logical  rather  man  a 
chronological  one. «But  the  order  is as follows.  First,  God's  election  or predesti-
nation. Next, adoption as sons, which is also called vocation, since the Lord draws 
to himself  those  to  whom  he  has  given  his  Spirit,  and  gives  them  knowledge  of 
himself  for  which  he  has  destined  them  from  eternity.  Then  in  the  third  place 
comes holiness  of life  and the duties of love, by which good works are produced. 
When men  see them, they glorify  the heavenly Father, from  whose goodness they 
proceed.  So  that,  fourthly,  there  is  in  the  saints  the  glory  of  God,  resulting  from 
the righteousness, with which God has deigned to adorn them»85. 

The  various  elements  (vocation,  justification,  and  glorification  as  well  as 
sanctification,  which  is not explicit in Romans  8:28-30)  are emphasised  in  differ(cid:173)
ent  ways  at  different  times.  At  times  vocation  and  justification  are  stressed. 
«Therefore,  whomever  God  has  foreordained  to  eternal  life,  he calls  in  his  time, 
and  gives  him  to  believe  his  Word.  Romans  8:30  and  Acts  13:48»86.  For  «God 
sends  those  who  announce  the gospel», and then  «the  Spirit  persuades  the  hearts 
of the elect» «at the time God has appointed for them»87. 

Vocation  may  be distinguished  logically,  if  not chronologically,  from  justifi(cid:173)

cation and sanctification,  but it is inseparably bound up with them. This is evident 
in the variety  of names by  which  it is called,  such  as adoption88  or conversion  or 
grafting  into Christ89.

(204.A.24-B.12; 67.A.14-22; 169.B.22-170.C.7).

Vocation, justification,  and sanctification  are related  to outward  means, for  it 
is through the preaching of the Word that the elect are called. «There is, therefore, 
need here of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to persuade the hearts of the elect of 
the  gospel.  In  this  way  as  many  as  are  foreordained  to  eternal  life  are  at  length 
called  and  drawn  by  the  Father  to  the  Son.  And  this  is  that  hearing  from  which 
faith  proceeds  (Roman  10).... Thus, after  the election  of the  saints, the next  thing 
is  that  God  penetrates  the  hearts  of  his  own  by  the  Word,  of  which  however  he 
persuades  them  by  his  Spirit.  From  this  persuasion  and  the  certain  faith  which 
they already  have in his words, there follow  trust  in him, love for  him, and a will 
ready to please him in all things»90. 

Emphasis on the life of the Christian or sanctification  is expressed in a variety 
of  ways  which  are  related  directly  or  indirectly  to  election.  In  his  earliest  work 
Bucer said that Christians  are created  for  good works as a bird for  flying  or a fish 
for  swimming91.  «For  our  salvation  is  nothing  other  than  being  conformed  to 
Christ,  that  is,  our  entire  selves  given  in  love  to  our  neighbours»92.  «For  those 
elect  to  this  from  all  eternity,  whom  this  renewing  power  of  God  inspires,  he  so 
renews, so transforms,  so makes them despise carnal things and admire things ce-
lestial,  so Strips away  their  self-love  and  fires  them  with love of  their  neighbour, 
that  they  are  a  source  of  wonder  to  men  of  this  age...»93. The  same  emphasis  is 
present  to  the  end  in  the  lectures  on  Ephesians  in  1551. «The  final  causes  [of 
election] are the sanctification  of life and the glory of God. For it is not the sancti(cid:173)
fication  of  our life  that  is the chief  purpose  of  our election, but  the very  glory  of 
God.  It is on  account  of  this  and  for  this that  all things  were created  and  that we 
have been regenerated»94. 

In Zwingli election was not spoken of,  at least initially, as leading to vocation, 
justification,  sanctification,  and  glorification.  Later  it  was  spoken  of  as  prior  to 
faith and sanctification,  though even then it was not expressed as systematically as 
by Bucer with his sense of the order of salvation. 

Like Zwingli, Bucer was concerned with signs of election. It was also a matter 
which  arose  in  his  first  major  discussion  of  predestination  in  «Against  Treger». 
Treger  argued  that  the  church  was  the  baptised.  Bucer,  by  contrast,  defined  the 
church in terms of the elect. This led naturally to the question whether one can di-
stinguish the elect from  the reprobate. 

Bucer indicated  the difficulty.  He pointed  out that Peter denied Christ and ap-
peared to human judgement not to be a Christian95. In «St Matthew», however, he 
spoke of a distinction between  the elect and reprobate even before  they respond to 
the  gospel.  The  reason  for  this  is that  there  is  always  «some  seed  of  God  in  the

elect».  Hence  there  is  «a  zeal  for  the  truth,  even  at  a  time  when  they  attack  the 
truth, or are leading a life  which  undoubtedly  conflicts  with it. Thus Paul devoted 
himself to the traditions of his fathers  more than his contemporaries did»96. 

In «Ephesians» the sin against the Holy Spirit is regarded as a clear sign of the 
reprobate, but the example of the penitent  thief  is seen as a warning against rejec-
ting  anyone  not  committing  this  sin97.  Indeed  it  is by  the  gift  of  the  Holy  Spirit 
that the elect  and  regenerate  are distinguished,  as the elect  have the  seed  of  God, 
that  is,  the  Holy  Spirit.  From  this  come  a  repugnance  to  evil  and  an  impulse  to 
good98. The elect can be recognised by the fruit  of the Spirit. The reprobate  follow 
the affections  of the flesh,  whereas the elect wage war against the flesh,  and when 
they do evil, detest it99. 

In  «St  John»  the  distinction  between  elect  and  reprobate  is  more  directly 
theological:  it  is related  to  the  divinity  of  Christ100  or  the  ability  to  see  the  Holy 
Spirit101.  However  the  gifts  of  the  Spirit,  unlike  the  fruit  of  the  Spirit,  are  not  a 
sign  of election. Thus Saul had  the gift  of ruling  and Judas the gift  of casting  out 
demons, but they lacked the Spirit of piety102. In «Psalms»  Bucer Stresses that we 
cannot  teil who  is elect  or reprobate. Some  who seem  bad here will later be  seen 
to  be  good103.  It  is  God  alone  who  decides.  He  knows,  whereas  we  can  judge 
wrongly as, for example, David's sons did, after  what Nathan had said104. 

Bucer's  discussion  of  signs  of  predestination  is  largely  limited  to  the  com-
mentaries,  where  he  expounds  the  text  of  scripture.  It  reflects  in  some  ways  the 
diverse  testimony  of  scripture.  The  Holy  Spirit  is  for  him  the  mark  of  the  elect, 
not however by his gifts  which the reprobate share, but by his fruit.  The fruit  may 
be  discerned  in  some  measure  in  the  elect  before  they  believe,  though  this  view 
seems  limited  to the early  commentaries. The only  clear  mark  of the reprobate  is 
the  sin  against  the Holy  Spirit.  Although  they  may  sometimes  seems  to  embrace 
the truth, their lives are never transformed,  because they lack the Holy  Spirit105. 

From  the beginning  Bucer  accepts  that  the  elect  sin.  In  «Against  Treger»  he 
speaks  of God's allowing  this, so that they  do not become proud106.  However be(cid:173)
cause they are elect, they cannot fall, but can err only for a time, «for the gifts  and 
calling  of God  are  irrevocable»107. He later  distinguishes  between  sin in the elect

and  sin  in  the  reprobate.  In  «St  Matthew»,  Bucer  could  even  say  that  if  Paul  had 
persisted  in  his  sin  after  his  experience  on  the  Damascus  road,  he  would  have 
been  guilty  of  the  sin  against  the  Holy  Spirit.  But  he  could  not  so, because  he  was 
elect108. 

3. 

Both  Zwingli  and  Bucer  stressed  the  sovereignty  of  God,  but  one  important  diffe-
rence  between  them  lies  in  the  place  of  predestination  within  their  theology  and 
their  use  of  Romans  8:28-30  in  expressing  predestination.  These  lead  to  a  stronger 
role  in  Bucer  than  in  Zwingli  for  Word  and  sacrament  and  a  clearer  sense  of  the 
Order of  salvation  (and  with  that  a  stronger  emphasis  on  sanctification).  In  Zwingli 
predestination  is  used  negatively  to  deny  the  role  of  the  sacraments  in  salvation 
rather  than  positively  to  limit  their  effectiveness  to  the  elect.  Zwingli  also  seems 
to  use  predestination  relatively  more  than  Bucer  against  Anabaptists  in  support  of 
the  baptism  of  infants  on  the  basis  of  election  (over  against  the  Anabaptist  insi-
stence  on  faith).  Bucer  seems  to  use  it  more  often  against  Catholics.  Zwingli  pre-
fers  the  term  election  and  his  stress  is  on  election  rather  than  reprobation.  With 
Bucer  the  accent  is  more  on  election  than  reprobation,  but  he  engages  with  repro(cid:173)
bation  more  than  Zwingli. 

Both  speak  of  signs  of  election,  though  Bucer  is  more  cautious  and  keeps  clo-
ser  to  the  biblical  text.  They  both  believe  people  can  be  recognised  by  their  fruit, 
but  Bucer  is  more  consistent  in  qualifying  this,  with  examples  such  as  that  of  the 
penitent  thief. In  Bucer  there  is  a stress  on  the  seed  of  election,  that  is  the  presence 
of  the  Holy  Spirit  in  the  elect.  This  leads  him  to discuss  the role  of  the  Spirit  in  the 
elect  before  they  hear  the  Word.  Later  his  emphasis  is  rather  on  the  work  of  the 
Spirit  with  the  Word.
