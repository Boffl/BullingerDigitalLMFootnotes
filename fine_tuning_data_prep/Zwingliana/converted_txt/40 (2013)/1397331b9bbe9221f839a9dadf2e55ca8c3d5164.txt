Biblical and Theological Themes in

Heinrich Bullinger’s »De Testamento«

(1534)

Joe Mock

Bullinger’s treatise on the covenant, De testamento (1534)1, is sur-
prisingly rich in biblical and theological themes. Most studies on
the theology of Heinrich Bullinger have focussed, naturally
enough, on the Decades and The Second Helvetic Confession.2
Many of Bullinger’s works are either historical or biblical theolo-
gical in their emphasis. Moser has identified that Bullinger’s his-
torical works can be classified as salvation history and history of
the covenant.3 Moreover, Walser affirms that Bullinger was pri-
marily a biblical theologian and that, therefore, his theology re-
flects the non-systematic character of the Bible itself.4 In this con-
nection, De testamento has primarily been viewed as Bullinger’s

extended exposition of Genesis 17 and the outlining of the nature
of the covenant, the parties of the covenant, the conditions of the
covenant, that the covenant is the subject of all Scripture as well as
his understanding of the sacrament of the covenant.5 This article
seeks to demonstrate that close investigation of De testamento re-
veals a raft of biblical and theological themes in addition to that of
the covenant. The fact that, from 1537 onwards, De testamento
was appended to In omnes apostolicas epistolas (1537)6 together
with Utriusque in Christo naturae divinae quam humanae (1534)7
indicates Bullinger’s desire for his readers to see the intimate link
between the incarnation and the plan of salvation that was ex-
pressed in the Scriptures through the theme of the covenant.

For too long Bullinger has been considered a theological light-
weight in comparison with other reformers. However, with careful
study of Bullinger’s meticulous use of terminology and the high
number of quotations and allusions to the Scriptures, this article
shows that De testamento was not just a work hastily put together
to address the ongoing challenges of Anabaptism or the charge
that the reformed faith was heretical as it was adjudged to have
deviated from the true faith. De testamento expresses Bullinger’s
understanding of the message of the canon which Bullinger began
to work on and develop during his productive period at Kappel am
Albis. Hence there is a plethora of biblical and theological themes
in a work written in the shadow of the defeat at the Zweiter Kap-
pelerkrieg and Bullinger’s own stirring Karlstag sermon of 1532.8
Bullinger’s De testamento deserves a more prominent place in the
Reformation corpus.

1. The title page

As was his usual practice, on the title page of De testamento Bul-
linger cited Matthew 17:5 in the following manner:

IESUS

HIC est filius dilectus in quo

placata est anima mea, ipsum audite.

Matthaei 17.

The particular significance of Matthew 17:5 for De testamento, in
particular, indicates that Bullinger believed Jesus to be the goal or
focus of the covenant and, thereby, the goal of the whole canon.
Hence his name is printed in upper case. Opitz also sees in this
passage a reference to both the priestly and rabbinic role of Christ
who, as Redeemer, fulfills the covenant.9

The transfiguration of Christ together with Moses and Elijah
reaffirmed for Bullinger that the Law and the Prophets find their
climax in and were fulfilled in Christ. To hear Christ only was
equivalent to hearing only what Scripture says. Bullinger had in the
back of his mind the prophet to come referred to in Deuteronomy
18:15. Certainly Bullinger emphasized the significance of Acts 3:22
in De testamento.10 Moreover, it is apparent that Bullinger is in-
dicating that Christ came to bring the new Torah (His Word which
would be written on the hearts of men and women in fulfillment of
Jeremiah 31) which would replace the Torah of the Old Testament.
In De testamento Bullinger emphasizes that the Torah had already
been inscribed on the hearts of the patriarchs before it was in-
scripturated at the time of Moses and that it was written more
fully by the Spirit with the coming of Christ and the new covenant.
In an earlier work, Antwort an Burchard,11 Bullinger was insistent
that one should listen to Christ alone, which means to obey only
him.12 In his commentary on Matthew (1542) Bullinger directly

referred to Deuteronomy 18 and Peter’s sermon of Acts 3 as well
as Stephen’s sermon of Acts 7.13

2. Justification by faith

The fact that Bullinger prefers placata to placita on the title page of
his books underscores the fact that the central theme in Bullinger is
that of reconciliation with God through justification by faith, de-
spite Baker’s insistence that the covenant is the centre of Bullin-
ger’s thought.14 The covenant is indeed central to Bullinger without
being the actual centre of his works. Significantly, one of the main
themes of The Old Faith (1537) is that the patriarchs of the Old
Testament were justified by faith in Christ in the same way as
saints in the new covenant. Justification by faith alone in Christ
alone is clearly expressed in De testamento as is evident from the
following quote:

»Abraham was assuredly justified by faith alone, prior to circumcision and
prior to the law, without the ceremonies, without the law. He also saw the
day of the Lord Jesus and he rejoiced.«15

Each of these phrases was carefully chosen, viz. »by faith alone«,
»without ceremonies«, »prior to the circumcision«, »prior to the
law« and »without the law«. Indeed, these phrases need to be
borne in mind when reading De testamento, especially whenever
Bullinger refers to the »conditions« of the covenant. The direct
citation of John 8:56 was Bullinger’s tacit manner of stating that
Abraham was justified by faith alone in Christ alone. The fact that

Abraham was justified before he was circumcised was repeated by
Bullinger in the Epilogue.16 In clearly alluding to the catch-cry of
the Reformation of sola fide, Bullinger was underscoring the fact
that the faith taught and practised by the reformers was indeed
faithful to a true understanding of Scripture. This is further un-
packed by Bullinger in the Epilogue of De testamento where he
writes: »... in order that I might indicate in passing the clarity,
simplicity, and antiquity of Scripture and of our religion, which
today is ill-spoken of by many people, as if it were heretical.«17

Because of the extended discussion in De testamento of the
»conditions« of the covenant many have incorrectly deduced that
Bullinger was synergic in his understanding of justification because
his emphasis on the covenant was adduced to be »bilateral«. In
point of fact, Bullinger viewed the covenant in a monopleuric man-
ner for his discussion of the covenant must be seen in the context
of God’s accommodation to the customs of mankind.18 There is no
doubt that, for Bullinger, salvation is all of God’s grace. Thus
Bullinger points out that: »This certainly is the origin of our reli-
gion and it is its principal point: we are saved only through the
goodness and mercy of God.«19

3. God’s accommodation to mankind

One unmistakeable and overarching theme in De testamento is the
accommodation of God. As is widely known, this also is empha-
sized in Calvin’s works. Garcia Archilla notes that Bullinger un-
derscores the covenant as the accommodation of God: »Bullinger
has established, on a Biblical basis, his understanding of the co-
venant. He is most conscious that this is not a deal between equal
partners, but once more underlines that it is an accommodation by
God to our imbecillitas, our incapacity to stand at the same level

with God on account of our creatureness.«20 Bullinger explains
that God was pleased to use a human expression (humana appel-
latione) and follow human custom (humanum morem) on account
of the weakness (imbecillitatem) of human nature when he initi-
ated the covenant.21 Indeed, Bullinger makes a point to state that
»God has acted according to human custom at every point.«22
Bullinger understands God’s accommodation to mankind through
the covenant as a condescension to the finiteness and frailty of
humanity. He expresses this in terms of »... sets forth the divine
nature, as much as he wishes to show himself to us.«23

There is no doubt whatsoever that Bullinger upheld the Refor-
mation formula of sola gratia.24 Because of his repeated emphasis
on faithful obedience to the covenant and because he was cited by
the Remonstrants at the Council of Dordt, Bullinger came to be
suspected of being semi-Pelagian. However, careful study of De
testamento reveals this not to be the case at all. Bullinger always
upheld justification by faith alone. Several times in De testamento
Bullinger emphasizes that it is God who initiated the covenant. It
was »not in any way because of the merits of humans but rather
out of ... the sheer goodness and mercy of God.«25 Then in a re-
ference to the Anabaptists, who over focused on the »conditions«
of the covenant taken out of their biblical context, Bullinger argues
that »those people who consider only the conditions of the cove-
nant and in fact disregard the grace and promise of God exclude
infants from the covenant.«26

A correct understanding of God’s accommodation means that El
Shaddai employed human customs and human language to express
and explain his gracious relationship with mankind. Following
scholars such as Mendenhall and others, it might appear natural to
refer to Hittite suzerain treaties to explain the Biblical covenant
with their measure of mutuality between the two parties. However,
a more accurate parallel, albeit limited, is that of the covenant of

royal grant.27 The manner that Bullinger unpacks the biblical wit-
ness of the covenant is closest to the covenant of royal grant. This
can be illustrated by the fact that Bullinger cites Micah 6:8 in De
testamento which he employs to explain what it means to respond
to God in faith for »It is our duty to adhere firmly by faith to the
one God, inasmuch as he is the one and only author of all good
things, and to walk in innocence of life for his pleasure.«28

One related aspect of Bullinger’s understanding of God’s accom-
modation is his fondness for explaining that God gives himself and
that God pours himself into the believer. In doing so, Bullinger is
re-echoing the testimony of Scripture that the covenant is not so
much the means of giving blessings to the covenant people but the
very giving of El Shaddai himself for the good of his elect. Thus
Bullinger explains that »The God of heaven, that highest and eter-
nal power and majesty ... offers himself for their benefit.«29 He
further adds that God »poured out his entire self for us.«30 Bullin-
ger’s emphasis on God giving himself through the covenant and of
pouring himself into the believer (hence union with the believer) is
further developed by him in the Decades.31 Bullinger thus acknow-
ledges God’s accommodation to mankind is expressed in the Scrip-
tures through anthropomorphic language. Although Bullinger may
refer to »binding« and »conditions« and the like in terms of God’s
covenant relationship with mankind these terms must not be view-
ed through the lens of mutual, human pacts. There is no doubt
whatsoever that Bullinger believed unreservedly in sola gratia as is
illustrated by his comment that »circumcision was given to those
to whom the grace and the covenant of God was first offered,
through the assistance and the institution of God who did not
scorn being the God of little children and who also first offered

Journal of the American Oriental Society 93 (1973), 190–199. Especially characteristic

truth,« »his heart was whole to his master,« »walked in perfection.«

himself to us out of sheer grace (mera gratia) and said, ›I will be
your God.‹«32

Furthermore, akin to the Apostle Paul’s doxology at the end of
Romans 11, Bullinger is aware that, because of the finiteness of
mankind, it is beyond human ability to fully understand the signi-
ficance of God’s accommodation through the covenant. Hence, he
observes: »I do not know whether humans are capable either of
conceiving this mystery fully or conveying how praiseworthy it
is.«33

4. The covenant is the subject of all Scripture

Bullinger contends that the covenant is »the subject of all Scrip-
ture«. He refers to the covenant as a »target at which all Scripture
aims«.34 The following lengthy quote demonstrates how Bullinger
understands the covenant to be central to the message of the ca-
non:

»For whatever things have been said in the Holy Scripture about the unity,
power, majesty, goodness and glory of God are included in this one ex-
pression of the covenant: ›I am the all-sufficient Lord‹. Whatever promises
have been written about bodily blessings, glory, the kingdom, victories,
labors, and the basic needs of life, are included in this one expression of the
covenant: ›I will give to you and to your descendants the land of Canaan; I
will be their God‹. In the same way, those things which have been handed
down afterwards at various times about Christ the Lord, both in figure and
in truth, whatever has been said about his justice, about the sanctification
and redemption of the faithful, about the sacrifice, the priesthood, and the
satisfaction of Christ, about the kingdom and eternal life, and, further,
about the calling of all peoples, about spiritual blessings, about the abro-
gation of the law, about the glory of the church gathered from the Gentiles
and Jews, are foretold in this single promise: ›And all the nations will be
blessed in you and you will be the father of many peoples.‹«35

34 The marginal comment on folio 16r reads: »Omnis Scriptura ad foedus ceu sco-

pum refertur«.

Key theological themes are referred to by Bullinger in this extended
quote which are directly related to the overarching theme of co-
venant in Scripture. In particular, the theme of the covenant is
linked with the theme of the kingdom in the context of promise
and fulfillment. Indeed, the King, Christ, is Kyrios in whom is
fulfilled the priesthood and sacrificial system of the Old Testament,
whose fully satisfactory sacrifice demonstrates the justice of God
for the redemption and sanctification of mankind (both Jew and
Gentile) who are gathered as members of His church. It is thus
abundantly evident that, for Bullinger, the covenant is the back-
bone and basis to all biblical themes.

In his study of the Decades, Opitz correctly concludes that, for
Bullinger, the message of the whole canon is first and foremost
theological and then christological. This is evident from the chap-
ter headings in his book.36 Bullinger views the main message of the
Bible as reconciliation with God through being justified by faith in
Christ alone. The covenant, for Bullinger, is the way that God
unfolds his plan for the salvation of the elect. His emphasis on God
as cornucopia or »the all-sufficient Lord« points to the theological
focus of Scripture. On the other hand, his frequent reference, in his
writings, to Christ as the seed of the second Eve who fulfils the
protoevangelium of Genesis 3:15 points to the Christological focus
of Scripture. A consideration of all the works of Bullinger may lead
to the conclusion that he views Genesis 1,2 and Revelation 21,22
as an inclusio to the whole canon which is, therefore, theological in
focus while Genesis 3 to Revelation 20 constitutes the »theology of
history«37 which is clearly christological in focus with the covenant
as its scopus. Like Irenaeus, Bullinger regards that one of the main
purposes of Scripture was to prepare the people of God in each
generation for the parousia.

36 »Gemeinschaft mit Gott im Hören auf Gottes Wort«; »Gemeinschaft mit dem
dreieinigen Gott«; »Gemeinschaft mit Gott als pneumatische Christusgemeinschaft«;
»Gemeinschaft als Leben im Bund«; »Gemeinschaft mit Gott als Leben mit dem Ge-
setz« and »Gemeinschaft mit Gott als Gemeinschaft der Heiligen«.

4.1 De testamento and the covenant with Adam

Although Bullinger refers to Adam several times in De testamento38
it is not well known that he did, in fact, refer to the protoevan-
gelium of Genesis 3:15 in De testamento in one of its textual ver-
sions. There appear to be two major textual versions of De testa-
mento, viz. the text of 153439 and the text appended to In omnes
apostolicas epistolas (1537).40 As might be expected, there are se-
veral minor orthographical differences between the two texts. The
major differences concern a revision of dates cited by Bullinger and
the insertion of some extra words.41 The most significant change,
however, is the insertion of three sentences that make a specific
reference to the covenant with Adam.
Inserted between the
sentence on folio 29v which reads, »Semen mulieris calcabit caput
serpentis ...« and the sentence which reads »Ergon inquis legem
citra consilium rationemque ...« the 1537 text has the following
additional sentences:

»Non enim hoc primum omnium foedus est quod pepigit cum Abraham,
sed illud primum est quod pepigit cum Adam. Unde disertis verbis in con-
sequentibus pactionibus dicitur, Erigam vel confirmabo vel statuam pactum
meum tecum, id est foedus semel initum firmiter servabo. Saepe enim re-
novatum est, idque certas ob caussas, ut cum Noe post diluvium nunc cum
Abraham, postea cum Mose. Unum tamen atque idem foedus est quod
confirmatur et stratuitur cum illis omnibus.«42

This may be translated as follows:

Indeed, the covenant which he made with Abraham is not the first of all the
covenants. Rather, the first covenant is the one which he made with Adam.
From which covenant with explicit words in the covenants that followed he
may say, »I will erect« or »I will confirm« or »I will establish my covenant
with you«, that is »I will keep firmly the covenant made at the beginning«.
In fact, the covenant was often renewed. This was because of certain cau-
ses, as with Noah after the flood, then with Abraham, and afterwards with
Moses. Nevertheless, it is the one and the same covenant which is confirm-
ed and established with all of these.

Although Bullinger does refer to »covenants« in the plural, he cle-
arly considers them the one and the same covenant that God made
with Adam. Thus, Bullinger emphasized that Christ came to renew
and fulfill the covenant both as the son of Adam and as the seed of
Eve. As with Zwingli in his In catabaptisarum strophas elenchus,43
Bullinger interprets the protoevangelium of Genesis 3:15 as refer-
ring to a covenant with Adam and his seed, which would subse-
quently be renewed through the covenant with Abraham and his
seed.44

Bullinger first referred to the covenant with Adam in Vom dem
Touff45 and Antwort an Burchard.46 The clearest expression of Bul-
linger’s understanding of the theological significance of Genesis
3:15, however, is found in The Old Faith (1537)47. It may be re-
asonably assumed, therefore, that since The Old Faith makes such
a significant and pointed reference to a covenant with Adam that
Bullinger decided to revise De testamento in 1537 with the inser-
tion of the three sentences referred to above. Subsequent writings
of Bullinger certainly referred to the covenant with Adam.48 A stu-

48 Apart from key sections in the Decades, Bullinger referred to the covenant with
Adam in the following works: The Evangelical Churches are neither Heretical nor Schis-
matic (1552); Von dem heiligen Nachtmal unsers Herrenn Jesu Christi (1553); Von dem

dy of all the letters that Bullinger wrote in the period 1534–1537,
however, reveals no reference to any change in De testamento.

Zwingli had referred to a covenant with Adam in In catabapti-
sarum strophas elenchus (1527). Although there is ongoing debate
about the dating of Vom dem Touff and Antwort an Burchard a
case can be made for Bullinger’s reference to the covenant with
Adam prior to that of Zwingli.49 It is clear, nonetheless, that for
both Zwingli and Bullinger the covenant with Adam was an in-
fralapsarian covenant of grace. The fact that some have misread
Bullinger’s understanding of the covenant with Adam is illustrated
by Dowey who pointed out that no less than a scholar such as
Koch50 has misunderstood Bullinger in reaching his conclusion that
Bullinger spoke of an »Adamic« covenant which laid the ground-
work for a »supralapsarian covenant of creation.«51

What is significant is that Bullinger refers to Adam twice in the
Epilogue of De testamento. On the first occasion it is in the con-
text of noting that the patriarchs before Abraham pleased God
through faith without circumcision.52 While on the other occasion
Bullinger asserts: »We have proven that the faith of Abraham,
Adam, and Christ was the same.«53

4.2 The unity of the Old and New Testaments

In explaining the meaning of the title De testamento, Bullinger
underlines the fact that the testament or covenant is both one and
everlasting. Bullinger argues that God established one single co-
venant and that both old and new covenants had the same essence
and the same basic requirements of faith and obedience leading to
love of God and neighbour. The people of the new covenant are

Feast Days of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (1558), the 1569 version of Compen-
dium Christianae Religionis; Bullinger’s commentary on Daniel (1565), Epitome tem-
porum et rerum ab orbe condito ad primum usque annum Iothan Regis Iudae (1565),
and Von der schweren langwirigen vervolgung der Heiligen Christlichen Kirchen
(1573).

co-continuous with the people of the old covenant. Bullinger’s
point is that the patriarchs had the same religio vera as that of the
new covenant because the substantia was the same.54 In almost a
parallel to John 14:6 Bullinger further declares: »There is therefore
one covenant and one church of all the saints before and after
Christ, one way to heaven, and one unchanging religion of all the
saints.«55 In citing 1 Corinthians 10:1–4 Bullinger points out that
the saints of both the old and new testaments had the same spiri-
tual food and drink. He further cites Augustine extensively from
his Commentary on the Gospel of John to justify his assertion that
both the old covenant patriarchs and the new covenant church
believe in Christ having the same faith: »The times are different,
but not the faith. Although the times did indeed differ, we see that
those of both times entered through the one doorway of faith, that
is, through Christ.«56 Moreover, Bullinger put in upper case the
declaration that there is one faith.57 Bullinger also cites Augustine
from his De Baptismo contra Donatistas to further substantiate his
point.58 Hence, Bullinger sums up as follows: »From all of this I
think it is truly evident that there is only one church and one
covenant, the same for the patriarchs and for us.«59

Bullinger does acknowledge that Scripture refers to the terms
»old« and »new« covenants as he cites Jeremiah 31:31–34,60 Eze-

54 »Praeterea multis hactenus approbavimus nihil apud posteros de religione vera,
quantum scilicet substantiam attinet, dictum fuisse, quod non audierint priores.« Bul-
linger, De testamento, 25r.

ecclesia, unica ad coelos via, unica item constansque omnium sanctorum religio.« Bul-
linger, De testamento, 25r.

56 »Tempora variata sunt non fides. Diversis quidem temporibus, sed utrosque per
unum fidei ostium, hoc est per Christum videmus ingressos.« Bullinger, De testamento,
27r.

57 »Apostolos dicit: Et nos credimus propter quod et loquimur. Ut scias autem quod
una sit fides, audi dicentem. Habentes eundem spiritum fidei et nos credimus.« Bullin-
ger, De testamento, 27v.

kiel 36:26, and Galatians 4:24 which says: »These are two cove-
nants (testamenta).« Significantly, Bullinger uses testamentum twi-
ce in his citation of the Jeremiah 31 passage whereas the Vulgate
has foedus and pactum. Bullinger’s argument is that the terms
»old« and »new« did not arise from the essence (substantia) of the
covenant but because of »certain foreign and unessential things«
(accidentibus) which were not »perpetual and particularly neces-
sary things for salvation«.61 Bullinger thus uses the Aristotelian
concepts of »substance« and »accidents« to explain the continuity
and discontinuity between the old covenant and the new cove-
nant.62 The »accidents« are clearly explained by Bullinger to be the
Aaronic priesthood, the sacrificial system of the old covenant, the
rites of purification, food and dietary laws, instructions for the
construction of the tabernacle and the like.63

Bullinger points out that the most important aspect of what
transpired through the Mosaic covenant was that the main points
of the covenant were reinstated but »unfolded more fully.« Sub-
sequently, the ceremonies (which the patriarchs did not have) were
added to restrain Israel from idolatry as well as to serve as types of
Christ who was to come as promised. Thus, apart from the cere-
monies, Bullinger declares: »Now, therefore, in respect to the De-
calogue and civil laws, no difference at all has arisen regarding the
covenant and the people of God. For everywhere the love of God
and the neighbor, faith, and love maintain the mastery.«64

Bullinger further asserts that under the old covenant there was
indeed forgiveness of sins (through Christ) and that there was an
emphasis on faith and love. Because of this, the new covenant
cannot be called »new« entirely on account of these facts, »since it
teaches nothing new.«65 The new covenant is called »new« because
all the ceremonies were fulfilled in Christ. Thus the »ancient reli-
gion« was »renewed (innovata) and restored more fully (plenius)

between the Old and New Testaments does not touch the substance of the covenant, but
only its accidents.« Cf. Calvin’s use of substantia and administratio in the Institutes
II.10.2.

and more clearly (dilucidius) by Christ and made perfect (absolu-
taque) with a new people, namely the Gentiles.«66 In addition,
Bullinger refers to the »enduring, spiritual terms of the covenant or
the promise of God.«67 To further underscore the continuity be-
tween the Testaments Bullinger declares that, »Even the Spirit is
the same in both Testaments.«68 He illustrates this through citing
Stephen’s sermon in Acts 7 that Stephen »proved with almost
countless examples from the ancients that faith in God before the
law, under the law, and after the law was pleasing to God, not
ceremonies.«69

While Bullinger clearly emphasizes the unity of the Old and New
Testaments, he acknowledges, at the same time, that there is both
continuity and discontinuity between the Testaments. For example,
Bullinger refers in a marginal comment to the reality that »we
surpass the ancients.«70 On the one hand, Bullinger cites the close
connection we have with the patriarchs whose religion »rested
upon faith and innocence without ceremonies, that is, on the basic
terms of the covenant ...«71 Furthermore, Bullinger alludes to the
fact that »the typological foreshadowings have been fulfilled.«72
But, on the other hand, Bullinger also points out that with the
coming of Christ, as promised, »God has made our church supe-
rior to the church of our dead fathers ... He has given his Spirit
most abundantly.«73

Bullinger anticipates objections to his view by considering, in
turn, Matthew 5, 2 Corinthians 3 and Deuteronomy 5. With re-
spect to Matthew 5, Bullinger argues that, »Christ attacked the
Pharisees, not the spirit of the law itself or of the prophets.«74
Similarly, Bullinger concludes of 2 Corinthians that, »Indeed, in
that passage he does not speak of the entire law but only that part

of the law which is abolished.«75 In referring to Deuteronomy 5
Bullinger cites both Augustine and Oecolampadius.76

A consideration of Bullinger’s references to the unity of the Old
and New Testaments in De testamento thus amplifies the signifi-
cance of the »one« in the title of the treatise: The One and Eternal
Testament or Covenant of God.

4.3 The seed of Abraham

Since Bullinger based his treatise on the covenant as an exposition
of Genesis 17 there is constant reference in De testamento to the
theme of the seed of Abraham. Folio 6r commences a paragraph
with the marginal heading »Deus iniit foedus cum semine Abra-
ham«. The immediate following paragraph has the marginal
heading »Qui sint semen Abrahae«.77 Bullinger underscores that
Christ is the seed of Adam through his incarnation, that he is the
seed of Eve78 and the true seed of Abraham (de vero semine Abra-
hae).79 Bullinger further points out that the seed of Abraham who
inherit the covenant promises given to him and his seed are the
spiritual seed of Abraham who, in turn, have received true circum-
cision as referred to by Jeremiah in chapter 4 and Paul in Romans
2.80 In citing Galatians 3:29 Bullinger affirms that »Those who are
Christ’s are the seed of Abraham.«81 Bullinger’s explanation of the
true seed of Abraham must be seen in the context of the unity of
the Old and New Testaments. Hence Bullinger affirms that: »Abra-
ham was clearly justified by faith alone, without ceremonies, prior
to circumcision and the law (Romans 4:1–13). He saw the day of
the Lord Jesus and rejoiced (John 8:56).«82

Since De testamento was written by Bullinger83 inter alia to
grapple with issues raised by the Anabaptists, Bullinger emphasizes
that the children of believers are the seed of Abraham and, there-
fore, should receive baptism, the sign of the new covenant.84 Fur-
thermore, since texts of De testamento which were appended to In
omnes apostolicas epistolas clearly referred to the protoevangelium
of Genesis 3:15, Bullinger also emphasized that Christ was the seed
of Eve. As the seed of Eve, Christ came as the blessed Seed of God.
Indeed the linking of Genesis 3:15, Genesis 17:7 and Galatians
3:16 is a constant theme in The Old Faith as can be attested by the
number of times »seed«, »blessed Seed« and »promised Seed« are
referred to.85

4.4 The covenant and right living

The well-known opening thematic statement of Calvin’s Institutes
appears to reflect what is clearly in Bullinger’s mind when he ex-
plains in De testamento concerning the covenant: »The entire sum
of piety consists in these very brief main points of the covenant.
Indeed, it is evident that nothing else was handed down to the
saints of all ages, throughout the entire Scripture, other than what
is included in these main points of the covenant, although each
point is set forth more profusely and more clearly in the succession
of times.«86 Just as religio in Calvin’s Institutio Christianae Reli-
gionis referred primarily to Christian »living« rather than »doc-
trine« so Bullinger’s De testamento focusses on right living in a
right relationship with El Shaddai. This fact must surely be unders-
cored by the only Swiss German sentence in the whole treatise:
»Schickt dich wohl und rae cht zewandeln und zelae benn« – prepare
yourself to walk and live uprightly.87

There is no doubt that Bullinger was concerned not only for the
right interpretation of Scripture but also for right living. Indeed,
most of his works are highly pastoral in emphasis. As Garcia Ar-
chilla rightly observes: »De testamento does not constitute a sys-
tematic and exhaustive treatment of all theological loci ... The
function of De testamento is not to provide a full systematic doc-
trine, but to show the consistency, coherence and integrity of the
Biblical testimony about God’s plan of salvation by means of the
promise/foedus/testament cluster of concepts.«88 De testamento
concludes with a word of encouragement citing Psalm 25:10 that
reflects Bullinger’s pastoral heart: »All the paths of the Lord are
grace and faith to those who keep his testament and covenant.«89

4.5 The Holy Spirit and the covenant

Garcia Archilla has argued that there is insufficient reference to the
role of the Holy Spirit in De testamento.90 However, in point of
fact, there is a catena of references to the Spirit in De testamento.
The very first sentence of De testamento is an affirmation of the
fact that the Scriptures were inspired by the Spirit and that with
the assistance of that same Spirit Bullinger is seeking to give an
exposition of the testament or covenant of God.91 He further
points out that it is the same Spirit who continues to speak through
of the Old Testament and the New Testament.92 On several occa-
sions Bullinger refers to spiritual Israel vis-a`-vis Israel that is only
concerned for the ceremonies for it is the spirit that counts and not
the flesh.93 While acknowledging the role of the Holy Spirit in the
old covenant, Bullinger does assert that God »has given his Spirit
most abundantly« (i.e. to the church post-Christ).94

wohl und recht vor mir zelaeben.«

Bullinger thus views the Spirit as the author of Scripture as well
as the Enabler amongst the elect (whom he terms »spiritual Israel«
in the Old Testament era) so that they might live integer before El
Shaddai. It is through the Spirit that the covenant is inscribed on
the hearts of the Patriarchs before its inscripturation at the time of
Moses. It is through the Spirit that the Torah of Christ is inscribed
on the heart of believers in the new covenant.

5. The Law and the covenant

The Law summarizes for Bullinger the »conditions« of the cove-
nant for »the Law truly teaches, with the Lord himself as witness,
partly the love of God and partly the love of neighbour.«95 Bullin-
ger understands Torah as »instruction« rather than in a forensic
sense. Bullinger thus declares: »the Decalogue itself seems to be
almost a paraphrase of the conditions of the covenant.«96 Since the
Decalogue was inscribed on tablets of stone by the very finger of
God when given to the Israelites at the time of Moses,97 Bullinger
seeks to declare that God is not only the giver of the Law but He is
also the witness (testis) so that the Law achieves its purpose of
instructing the seed of Abraham.

Bullinger is thus insistent that nothing »new« was introduced at
the time of Moses with the inscripturation of the Law. His point is
that the Law was already written on the heart.98 For, as a written
record of the covenant, the Law set forth how to love God and to
love one’s neighbour and, at the same time, looked forward to
Christ who is the goal of the covenant. Indeed, Bullinger points out
that Christ himself also »taught partly faith in God and partly love
of the neighbour. The former explains the first aim of the cove-
nant, the latter the second.«99 In the context of salvation history

(prior to Sinai, post Sinai and post Christ) Bullinger states that the
Decalogue and the civil laws continue to apply to the seed of Abra-
ham in the new covenant for »everywhere the love of God and the
neighbour, faith, and love maintain the mastery.«100 Bullinger’s
basis for this is his assertion that, prior to Sinai, Abraham was
already keeping the civil laws.101 It is clear that Bullinger does not
intend that the minutiae of the civil or judicial laws of the Old
Testament still apply to Christians. What is apparent is that Bul-
linger’s exposition of the covenant provides a basis for the role of
the Magistrate in Zurich alongside that of the ministers whose
ministry parallels that of the Old Testament prophets. The Magis-
trate is directly referred to on folio 19v.

Bullinger makes a point, through a mini excursus, to examine
some key Scriptures to deal with possible objections to his under-
standing of Law in the context of covenant. It is precisely in this
context that Bullinger cites Romans 10:4 to the effect that Christ
»is the fulfillment of the law for the justification for all who belie-
ve.« What has been abolished are the ceremonial aspects of the
law. He specifically cites Deuteronomy 5 to make the point that
the »circumstantial legalities« or the Torah in its details were given
because of the threat of idolatry and apostasy but that they, no-
netheless, »return to those ten words of the tablet of the cove-
nant.«102 Bullinger also addresses the charge that he is guilty of
espousing a view of the Law similar to the Ebionites, i.e. that sola
fide was insufficient and that, therefore, the Law must be kept. He
thus underlines his doctrine »of the single and eternal covenant of
God, and of the abrogation of legalities (abrogatione legalium).«103
Bullinger chooses his terminology carefully. What has been abro-
gated is not the Law but the »legalities«.104

In the final section of De testamento, immediately prior to the
Epilogue, Bullinger has a section on »The documents of the cove-
nant« (Tabulae testamenti conscribuntur) in which Bullinger rei-
terates that the whole canon is the record of the covenant. In par-

ticular, he draws the reader’s attention to Psalm 19 and 2 Timothy
3.105 Significantly, the second part of Psalm 19 is a focus on Torah
in the context of God’s revelation while 2 Timothy 3 emphasizes
Scripture in the context of instruction and right living.

5.1 The conditions of the covenant

Most scholars, in our opinion, wrongly interpret Bullinger’s refe-
rence to the »conditions« of the covenant. This is because they
regard the covenant in Bullinger as a mutual pact where the two
parties, the omnipotent God and horn of plenty on the one hand
and mankind on the other, have conditions to fulfill for the cove-
nant to be operating.106 Others regard the fulfilling of the condi-
tions as necessary for receiving the blessings of the covenant. For
example, Lee contends that: »In short, testaments or covenants are
legal documents that set forth a series of conditions and promised
blessings. These conditions and blessings are the content of both
testaments, the substantia, which remains unchanged despite the
fact that the covenantal records, and the manner in which the
substance is communicated, changes.«107 However, as Bullinger
makes it abundantly clear in De testamento, the covenant purely
arises from God’s initiative and is based purely on grace.

The »condition« of God is merely the affirmation of who God is:
»I am the abundantly all-sufficient God, the horn of plenty«108
which is encapsulated in His name, El Shaddai, revealed to Abra-
ham. Although the term »condition« is used, the marginal com-
ment clearly refers to God’s promise of giving Himself.109 The
»conditions« of mankind are delineated in the section which has

105 Bullinger, De testamento, 46v.

thought, as it developed in Zurich, was in fact a bilateral conditional covenant stressing
both God’s and man’s obligations towards one another in a pact.«

the marginal heading »The offices of man and what is fitting for
him.«110 It is to be noted that in this context that Bullinger cites
Deuteronomy 10:12 and Micah 6:8. In doing so, it is evident that
Bullinger understands that what is required of men and women in
covenant relationship with God is that they arrange their lives in
every aspect according to his will. Significantly, both these passa-
ges cited by Bullinger focus on the importance of love as an act of
the will as Israel’s response or »condition« of the covenant. The
Deuteronomy passage calls on Israel, who were about to enter the
Promised Land, to love the God of the covenant while the Micah
passage reminds Israel in the period of the monarchy that God
desires love (hesed) from them. Bullinger goes on to state in a later
section of the treatise that »love is the fountainhead of innocence
and uprightness of life.«111

Furthermore, what is paramount for Israel in covenant relati-
onship with El Shaddai is the heart. They are to rely utterly on
God. This follows from Bullinger’s understanding of El Shaddai.
The reference to Deuteronomy 13:4 in folio 15v confirms the con-
clusion that Deuteronomy 18:15 underlies the inscription on title
page of De testamento. Deuteronomy 18 commences with war-
nings of a »false« prophet. The coming of the true prophet referred
to in Deuteronomy 18:15 was fulfilled with the coming of Christ.
Since the apostles testify to this prophet, he thus continues to speak
to men and women through the Scriptures. Hence men and women
are called to »hear Him!« In a later section, Bullinger points out
that »in the life of Christ, which the Gospels have described rather
diligently as in a mirror so to speak, we see what we ought to
follow or avoid, what pleases or displeases God.«112 The message
of Christ which descendants of Abraham through the ages must
pay particular attention to is to live in a way to please God. As a
man, Christ gave the example of how to live in a way pleasing to
God, trusting in the provision of El Shaddai. This underlies Bullin-

23

ger’s use of placatus rather than placitus on the title page, for the
goal of the covenant is restored relationship between El Shaddai
and His people which was achieved through Christ. In the context
of this restored relationship the people of God are called to live to
please him. Hence, in the Epilogue, Bullinger cites Noah, Enoch,
Seth, Abel and Adam who (without Law) »pleased God through
faith without circumcision.«113

The clearest reference to the Anabaptists in De testamento oc-
curs when Bullinger points out: »For those people who consider
only the conditions of the covenant and in fact disregard the grace
and promise of God exclude infants from the covenant.«114 In jux-
taposing the »conditions« of the covenant with the grace and pro-
mise of God, it is evident that for Bullinger the conditiones of the
testamentum and foedus with God cannot be equated with the
conditions of human pacts, covenants, alliances, treaties or agree-
ments. Indeed, Bullinger points out that the people of God in all
ages are called »to walk in innocence of life for his pleasure.«115
Bullinger also asserts that the »conditions« of the covenant were
inscribed on the hearts of the patriarchs: »The Lord did not bother
to have any records written for the ancient patriarchs, for they
bore the covenant in their hearts,
inscribed by the finger of
God.«116

5.2 The ceremonies and the covenant

In contrast to the other reformers, what appears to be expressed
only by Bullinger is to view a sort of hiatus between the patriarchal
period and that ushered in by the coming of Christ with respect to
the Law. For Bullinger, it appears not to be a case of progressive
revelation simpliciter but, rather, »back to the future.« That is to
say, the Law (understanding Torah as »instruction« rather than in
a forensic sense) was already given in the time of Adam when it
was written on the heart. But at the time of Moses the Law was

113 Bullinger, De testamento, 48r: »qui sine circumcisione per fidem Deo placuerunt.«
114 Bullinger, De testamento, 7v–8r: »Qui enim conditiones duntaxat foederis expen-

dunt, gratiam vero et promissionem Dei negligunt, infantes foedere excludunt.«

115 Bullinger, De testamento, 16r. Italics added.
116 Bullinger, De testamento, 45r.

24

Joe Mock

inscripturated (on tablets of stone) and given together with the
ceremonies. With the coming of Christ the Law was once again
written on the heart through the Holy Spirit. This time more clear-
ly and the ceremonies were abolished. The Law that is written on
the heart with the coming of Christ is the Torah of Christ and
underlies ipsum audite.

What is abundantly clear is that Bullinger concludes that the
»holy patriarchs« (Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph)
were pleasing to God without the »ceremonies«.117 In citing Ga-
latians 3:16–17 he affirms, »Hence the patriarchs were saved by
the blessing of the covenant, not of the law or of the ceremo-
nies.«118 Significantly, Bullinger emphasizes at this point that the
law which »originated 430 years later does not make void this
covenant established earlier by God in Christ.«119 In this sentence
Bullinger is affirming the role of Christ in the covenant in the Old
Testament era prior to his incarnation. Just as, for Bullinger, the
New Testament can be viewed as case of ‘back to the future’ so the
covenant in Old Testament times is rightly termed a »testament«
because of its future fulfillment in the death, resurrection and as-
cension of Christ.

At the bottom of folio 28v Bullinger commences an explanation
for the giving of the »ceremonies« (the Aaronic priesthood, laws
for sacrifices and purification, food laws, instructions for the ta-
bernacle etc). Precisely on folio 29v immediately after the insertion
of the extra three sentences (vide supra) that refer to the covenant
with Adam, Bullinger has an extended section on the institution of
the Law120 and the »ceremonies«. Bullinger’s point is that because
the Israelites had become corrupted by their time in Egypt with the
result that they forgot the covenant with God and were falling
more and more into idolatry that God came to »the aid of the
collapsing covenant with certain supports.« The first »support«
was the inscripturating of the original covenant by having its main
points inscribed on tablets of stone by his own finger. The second
»support« was the ceremonies which included inter alia guidelines

25

for worshipping God. Bullinger emphasizes that the patriarchs did
not have these ceremonies. The ceremonies were added to the in-
scripturation of the covenant to counteract the incipient danger of
idolatry when Israel »continued to be unfaithful and wicked.«121
Bullinger continues to explain that the giving of the Law and the
ceremonies confirmed the covenant and, at the same time, God
»enveloped the mystery of Christ in these ceremonies as types.«122
The point being made by Bullinger is that when the »anti-type« has
come to fulfill the types then the types are dispensed with. Thus
Bullinger explains: »... all the ceremonies were fulfilled by Christ,
whom alone it (i.e. the new covenant) proclaims. Since they were
types and shadows of eternal things, they became obsolete.«123 Bul-
linger further points out concerning the ceremonies that, in the
sovereignty of God, they functioned as types and shadows of eter-
nal things and they were »spiritual« in their own right. This is
highlighted by Bullinger on folio 32r. Bullinger’s point is that there
were spiritual men and women in the Old Testament for whom the
ceremonies had a spiritual significance. The carnal person, on the
other hand, was the person »who depends on legalities without
knowledge and without the spirit and who firmly believes that he
can be saved through these legalities.«124

In perhaps one of the most enigmatic sentences of the treatise,
Bullinger makes this following observation on the instructions for
worship given together with the ceremonies: »Therefore, God in-
stituted his own worship, and he declared that it was pleasing to
him (Psalm 50), which he actually despised, so that, with this plan,
he confirmed the covenant, and in addition to that he enveloped
the mystery of Christ in these ceremonies as types.«125 The point
being made by Bullinger is that, to counteract the danger of falling
into idolatry, God gave to Israel, through Moses, instructions for
worship. The patriarchs had worshipped God without such in-
structions. Although this was not the worship God truly desired

from His people, nonetheless, he was able to use it to confirm the
covenant and, at the same time, employ them as types to be fulfil-
led and abolished in Christ.

One concrete example that illustrates Bullinger’s understanding
of Law and the ceremonies for the Christian is his understanding
of the Sabbath. On the one hand, he affirms that the Decalogue
still applies to believers in the new covenant as it was already
written on the heart of the saints well before they were given to
Moses. But on the other hand, in comparing believers in the new
covenant with the Old Testament patriarchs he points out that
»corporal circumcision did not exist with them, nor did the obser-
vance of the Sabbath (just as we do not observe it).«126 Clearly
Bullinger is referring to spiritual circumcision as opposed to phy-
sical circumcision and a spiritual observance of the Sabbath as
opposed to a ceremonial observance of the Sabbath.

6. The sacrament of the covenant

In yet another example of God’s accommodation to mankind in
the covenant, Bullinger commences a section concerning circum-
cision as the sacrament of the covenant by stating »Deus sanguine
foedus hoc dedicat«. Bullinger regards the blood shed through cir-
cumcision as finding its fulfillment in the death of Christ, the true
seed of Abraham. Thus the blood that is shed in circumcision that
sealed the old covenant, for Bullinger, foreshadows the blood of
the cross. Bullinger states that, in giving circumcision as a proleptic
sign of Christ, God »willed that the seed of Abraham itself be
circumcised, signifying that the true seed of Abraham itself be cir-
cumcised, signifying that the true seed of Abraham, Christ the
Lord, would confirm that covenant (testamentum) by his death
and blood.«127

Bullinger cites the words of Jesus from Matthew 26:28 »Hic est
sanguis meus, qui est novi testamenti« and, in doing so, states that
»those signs which prefigured the future death of Christ had to be

126 Bullinger, De testamento, 50v.

Themes in Heinrich Bullinger’s »De Testamento« (1534)

27

changed and, in their place, signs substituted that, with their mean-
ing, signify the completion of the most perfect justification.«128 He
further explains that Baptism and the Eucharist replaced circum-
cision and the Passover as sacraments of the new covenant.129 Cir-
cumcision, therefore, was not only a sign of the covenant and a
sign of God’s grace for it also signified the binding of the faithful
to God. It is because of this understanding that Bullinger is able to
state: »... the entire covenant was contained in the sacrament of the
covenant; in the same manner, the entire essence of the renewed
covenant is contained in our sacraments, Baptism and the Eucha-
rist.«130

On the basis of Jeremiah 4 and Romans 2 Bullinger points out
that, from the beginning, with reference to »the true circumcision«
there was reference to the spiritual seed of Abraham as opposed to
the carnal seed who trusted »in their birth and circumcision, or, if
you prefer, trusting in the flesh and in the ceremony of initiation
and taking pride in external things.«131 Bullinger, therefore, sees a
»spiritual Israel« in Old Testament times who have been circum-
cised spiritually as opposed to »carnal Israel« whose circumcision
was merely external. Although true spiritual circumcision was to
be fulfilled in the age of the new covenant, Bullinger, nonetheless,
viewed spiritual circumcision proleptically operating on the hearts
of »spiritual Israel« in Old Testament times. He further outlines
the folly of the carnal Jew as neglecting the basic conditions of the
covenant while, at the same time glorifying in their election as the
people of God because they are the physical descendants of Abra-
ham.132

Significantly, Bullinger did not link circumcision with the Law.
Circumcision was first and foremost a sign and seal of the cove-
nant. In the old covenant God »offers himself« to Israel »out of
sheer grace« and through circumcision binds the faithful to him-
self. Bullinger views that the whole extent of the old covenant was

justification, clearly in the context of God’s grace.

encapsulated in the sacrament of circumcision and that »entire
essence of the renewed covenant« in contained in Baptism and the
Eucharist.133

7. Bullinger’s covenant terminology in »De testamento«

Because of the continued use of the Latin Bible in the early part of
the 16th century Bullinger was careful with respect to his use of the
terms for »covenant«. The terms foedus, testamentum and pactum
were used interchangeably by Bullinger in De testamento though,
at times, particular nuances may be intended.134 Only a couple of
years prior to De testamento, at a critical point of his ministry,
Bullinger linked the terms testamentum, pactum and foedus in his
Karlstag sermon (1532).135 Moreover, in his commentary on He-
brews (1532) he writes: »Testamentum hoc, foedus et illud dei pac-
tum est.«136 It is not surprising, therefore, that on several occasions
in De testamento Bullinger juxtaposes these Latin terms.137

An analysis of the use of the words that Bullinger used for »co-
venant« in De testamento and the Decades yielded the following
results:

The weak disjunctive seu in De testamento seu foedere Dei indi-
cates that Bullinger intended these terms to be interchangeable.138
De testamento commences with Bullinger’s understanding of the
philological derivation and meaning of the terms testamentum and
foedus in that order. Significantly, Bullinger has no discussion on
pactum. Cocceius, on the other hand, clearly differentiated be-
tween foedus and testamentum as is evident from his Summa doc-
trinae de foedere et testamento Dei (Leiden, 1648).

An examination of Bullinger’s use of pactum in De testamento
reveals that Bullinger did use pactum on occasions to refer to the
covenant between God and mankind.139 However, in the majority
of the cases when pactum was used in De testamento, Bullinger
was quoting from the Latin Bible. On folio 38r Bullinger does have
a sentence which reads: »Verbis pactus est cum Abraham domi-
nus.«140 But this is the perfect participle active of paciscor and is a
(modified) quote from Oecolampadius’ commentary on Jeremiah.
In Bullinger’s own translations of Scripture he often replaced pac-
tum in the Vulgate with foedus.141 Hence Strehle’s comment that
»the word pactum pervades both Bullinger’s and the Franciscan’s
(i.e. Bonaventura) treatment of the covenant«142 is manifestly off

138 Furthermore, testamentum occurs before foedus in the title of the treatise.
139 Bullinger, De testamento, 7v: »pacto«; 20r: »pactis«; 21v: »pactum«.
140 Which McCoy and Baker, Fountainhead, 128 translate as: »The Lord made a pact
with Abraham with words.« Roth’s translation (Heinrich Bullinger Schriften, vol. 1, 88)
has: »Mit Worten hat der Herr mit Abraham einen Bund geschlossen.«

141 This can be illustrated from his translations of Isaiah 33:8; 55:3; Jeremiah 31:32;

31:33; 32:40; 33:20 (twice); 33:21; 33;25; 34:10 and 34:15.

med Doctrine of Covenant, Bern et al. 1988, 147.

the mark. Bullinger chose to use pactum sparingly to minimize any
reading of nominalist pactum theology into his works.

These references cited indicate the careful and deliberate way
Bullinger used testamentum. Sometimes it was the word of choice
for Bullinger while at other times it was interchangeable with foe-
dus. Contrary to Lee, Bullinger was consistent in the use of the
terms for covenant.143 What is apparently striking in the use of the
terms for »covenant« from the above word analysis of De testa-
mento is Bullinger’s preference for the term foedus, his relative
frequent use of testamentum and the deliberately sparing use of
pactum. This is clearly reflected in the title of the treatise – De
testamento seu foedere dei – where the order is testamentum be-
fore foedus. Furthermore, a similar use of the terms for covenant
by Bullinger is evident in the Decades. Indeed, Bullinger is consis-
tent with his use of these terms in the Studiorum ratio (1527).144
A study of Bullinger’s Swiss German version of De testamento –
Von dem einigen unnd ewigen testament oder pundt gottes (1537)
– reveals that Bullinger used pundt 158 times,145 testament 73
times and pact one time. Significantly each time pactum is used in
De testamento it is replaced by pundt in this work aimed at the
wider audience rather than the academy. Another striking feature
is that fact that Bullinger juxtaposed pundt with testament as
many as 21 times.

Bullinger’s use of the terms is somewhat distinct from that of
Calvin’s whose special focus on the covenant in the Institutes can
be found in Book II, sections 10 and 11. A study of these sections
reveals that Calvin used foedus 21 times,146 testamentum 8 times147
and pactum 3 times.148 Despite Lillback’s assertion that, for Cal-

143 Lee, Johannes Cocceius, 31–37.
144 Heinrich Bullinger Studiorum Ratio – Studienanleitung, ed. Peter Stotz, Zurich
1987, §20: »Deus caeli, Deus ille omnipotens pepigit cum humano genere testamentum,
pactum seu foedus sempiternum.«

145 This count includes pundt in compound nouns.
146 The participle foederatos was used once at II.10.1.
147 Not counting the occasions when the reference was directly to either the Old
Testament or the New Testament. In Calvin’s French edition of the Institutes (Geneva:
Philbert Hamelin, 1554) l’alliance was used to translate both foedus and testamentum
in II.10 and II.11.

148 These three times occur in Calvin’s citation of Jer 31:31–34 in the Vulgate. Bul-
linger, on the other hand, replaced pactum with foedus in his translation of Jer 31:31–34.

vin, testamentum is a true synonym for foedus and pactum, there
appears to be no evidence for this in the Institutes II.10,11.149

The conclusions reached here, therefore, are at variance with
those proposed by Hagen who sought to examine the use of tes-
tamentum by the early Luther.150 Hagen’s thesis is that there was a
development from testament to covenant theology in the first
quarter of the sixteenth century.151 Some have suggested that Bul-
linger was influenced by Luther’s use of the terms for »covenant«
in his De captivitate Babylonica ecclessiae praeludium (1520).152
Although Luther did juxtapose the terms pactum, foedus and tes-
tamentum on one occasion in this work,153 it is apparent that, in
the section that deals with »testament« or »covenant«, foedus is
used only very sparingly.154 Clearly, Luther did not view the terms
foedus and testamentum as interchangeable. Bullinger’s use of tes-
tamentum, however, reflects the usage by both Irenaeus155 and Au-
gustine156 linked to his conviction that the saints in the old cove-
nant had faith in Christ, in particular, proleptically in his death
and resurrection.

8. Bullinger and Zwingli on the covenant

The vast majority of scholarly opinion is clearly of the view that
Zwingli wrote about the covenant before Bullinger who subse-
quently followed Zwingli’s lead and further developed the theme

149 Lillback, The Binding of God, has been influenced by Battles’ footnote (n. 6) at

interchangeably, as they are used in the Vulgate.« Institutes of the Christian religion, ed.

of the covenant.157 The main hinge of this view is the contention of
Cottrell that Bullinger himself in Von warer und falscher leer
(1527) stated that, as a Josiah figure, Zwingli rediscovered the
covenant.158 However, in light of Bullinger’s Diarium entry of 12
September 1524, it is abundantly clear that Bullinger was willing
to be deliberately self-effacing in order to accentuate the positive
contributions of Zwingli while seeking to downplay Zwingli’s ne-
gative contributions. Indeed, it is apparent that Bullinger did not
just follow Zwingli’s lead and then develop the ideas that are pres-
ented in De testamento. As several scholars have noted, Bullinger
did not refer to election in connection with the covenant as Zwing-
li had clearly done in his In catabaptistarum strophas elenchus.159
Election appears to be only hinted at in De testamento through
Bullinger’s several references to »spiritual« Israel as the true seed
of Abraham vis-a`-vis »carnal« Israel. Lillback160 has also conten-
ded that in De testamento Bullinger amplified Zwingli’s outline
based on Genesis 17 which is found in his Antwort über Balthasar
Hubmaiers Taufbüchlein.161 However, the outline that Lillback has
constructed from Zwingli is so general that any comparison would
be of limited value. As indicated above, Bullinger made a point of
emphasizing the covenant with Adam in the 1537 version of De
testamento. Examination of the covenant with Adam in both
Zwingli and Bullinger suggests that Bullinger was prior to Zwingli
with respect to the covenant and influenced Zwingli rather than
vice versa.162

With respect to the terms for »covenant«, Zwingli states in an
earlier work, Auslegen und Gründe der Schlußreden (1523), that

»Testamentum, pactum and foedus are often used interchangeably
in scripture. But testamentum is used most often. We therefore
refer to it here. It means ›legacy‹, but it is also used to mean
›agreement‹ or ›covenant‹ ...«163 A few lines later on Zwingli jux-
taposed several German terms for »covenant«.164 Locher assumed
that Zwingli was influenced by Budaeus for his developing an un-
derstanding of the covenant.165 Nonetheless, although Zwingli may
have been influenced by Budaeus philologically with respect to the
use of the Latin words for »covenant« as the use of these terms
were in a state of flux at the beginning of the 16th century, it is
proposed here that Zwingli was influenced by Bullinger for the
theological understanding of both Latin and German terms for
»covenant«.

An examination of Zwingli’s works reveals that in Von der Taufe
(May 1525) he juxtaposes pact and pflicht.166 In subsidium sive
coronis de eucharistia (August 1525) pactum and foedus are jux-
taposed,167 foedus and testamentum are juxtaposed (four times)168
while testamentum, foedus and pactum occur together on one oc-
casion.169 In Antwort über Balthasar Hubmaiers Taufbüchlein
(November 1525) pundt and testament are juxtaposed (four
times)170 while pundt and pflicht are juxtaposed (two times).171 In
De peccato originali declaratio ad Urbanum Rhegium (August
1526) foedus and testamentum are interchangeable.172 In Amica

Exegesis, id est: expositio eucharistiae negocii ad Martinum Lu-
therum (February 1527) Zwingli juxtaposes testamentum and foe-
dus173 as well as testamentum and pactum.174 Testamentum is by
far the term of choice for Zwingli in this work.175 In the Third Part
of In catabaptistarum strophas elenchus (July 1527) which focuses
on the covenant and election, Zwingli uses foedus 36 times, tes-
tamentum 36 times while pactum does not even occur once. Fur-
thermore, foedus and testamentum are juxtaposed five times.176
What is somewhat intriguing is that in the first part of this
section177 foedus is predominantly used while testamentum occurs
more often in the second section.178 In both the Fidei ratio (July
1530)179 and De convitiis Eckii (August 1530)180 foedus was the
word of choice for Zwingli.

These data reveal some subtle differences between Zwingli and
Bullinger. Firstly, through his continued use of pflicht, Zwingli
emphasizes the response of the believer to the covenant. This goes
in tandem with his understanding of sacramentum. Secondly, not-
withstanding his declaration in the Auslegen with respect to the
terms for »covenant«, Zwingli does not really use the terms foedus
and testamentum as interchangeable in his works, although he
does juxtapose them on occasions. Bullinger, on the other hand,
places more emphasis on the sacraments as signs and seals of
God’s grace and his initiative. Indeed, he points out that circum-
cision points to God binding the elect to himself. Furthermore,
throughout his works from the Studiorum ratio (1527) onwards,
Bullinger was consistent with the use of foedus and testamentum
which he viewed as interchangeable.

9. Conclusion

De testamento is a biblical theological and a biblical historical
treatise in which Bullinger cites many biblical and theological the-
mes. Far from being a work that only focuses on the covenant, on
the contrary, De testamento reveals Bullinger as a biblical theolo-
gian who is committed to challenge the elect to live integer before
the sovereign El Shaddai. Bullinger is consistent in his use for the
terms for »covenant« which differentiates him from Zwingli. This
indicates a measure of independence from Zwingli in his under-
standing of the covenant.

Joe Mock, Rev. Dr., Sydney

Abstract: De testamento is a both theological and a historically biblical treatise in which
Bullinger discusses themes such as, for example, justification by faith, God’s accom-
modation to mankind, the covenant as the subject or focus of all Scripture, the covenant
with Adam, the unity of the Old and New Testaments, the seed of Abraham, the co-
venant and right living, the Holy Spirit and covenant, the Law and covenant, the con-
ditions of covenant, the ceremonies of covenant and the sacrament of the covenant. Far
from being a work that only focuses on the covenant De testamento reveals Bullinger as
a biblical theologian who is committed to challenge the elect to live integer before the
sovereign El Shaddai. An examination of the Latin terms for »covenant« (foedus, tes-
tamentum and pactum) reveals that, for Bullinger, the terms are interchangeable. Ho-
wever, he avoids using pactum lest pactum theology be read into his work. His use of
the terms are more consistent than that of Zwingli which indicates a measure of inde-
pendence from Zwingli in his understanding of the covenant.
