The Sacraments in the Confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566 –

Bullinger’s Understanding in the Light of Zwingli’s

by Peter Stephens

The names of Zwingli and Bullinger are joined in such a way that it is natural
to think of Bullinger not only as the successor of Zwingli but also as a con-
tinuation of Zwingli. There is indeed continuity in their ministry and their
theology, but Bullinger is also distinctive both as a reformer and as a theolo-
gian. This is true for his view of the sacraments. As we look at Bullinger’s
understanding of the sacraments in the confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566, it
is instructive to see similarities and differences between him and Zwingli, as
well as the developments in his thought.

1 Zwingli’s Understanding of the Sacraments

The writings of Zwingli 1 most obviously comparable with these confessions
are  the  Sixty-Seven  Articles  (1523)  and  the  Marburg  Articles  (1529). 2
However, these do not reﬂect Zwingli’s theology in his ﬁnal years and it is
this to which Bullinger naturally refers. Three of his works from 1530–31,
to which Bullinger does refer, are: Account of the Faith presented to the Em-
peror  at  the  Diet  of  Augsburg  in  1530, Letter  to  the  Princes  of  Germany
again for the Diet in August 1530, in reply to Eck’s attack on Account of the

1 Most of Zwingli’s works are published in Emil Egli et al. (eds.), Huldreich Zwinglis Sämtliche
Werke (Berlin, Leipzig, Zurich, 1905–). Some which are not yet published in this modern
critical edition are available in M. Schuler and J. Schulthess (eds.), Huldreich Zwingli’s Werke
(Zurich, 1824–42). These editions are abbreviated as Z and S. The most substantial study of
Zwingli’s  sacramental  theology  and  its  relation  to  other  views  remains  Walther Köhler,
Zwingli und Luther. Ihr Streit über das Abendmahl nach seinen politischen und religiösen
Beziehungen, vol. 1 Leipzig 1924, vol. 2 Gütersloh 1953.
The eighteenth article in 1523 afﬁrms «that the mass is not a sacriﬁce, but a memorial of the
sacriﬁce and a seal of the redemption which Christ has shown to us». (Z I 460.8–10) The Mar-
burg articles on baptism and the eucharist are capable of a Zwinglian as well as a Lutheran in-
terpretation. The ninth article on baptism speaks of it as being not an empty sign, but «a sign
and work of God in which our faith is required, through which (faith) we are born again to
life». The ﬁfteenth on the eucharist has ﬁve points of agreement, including the statements that
it is «a sacrament of the true body and blood of Jesus Christ», that «the spiritual eating of the
same body and blood is above all necessary», and that the sacrament has been «given and or-
dained by almighty God so that weak consciences may be brought to faith through the Holy
Spirit». The only point of disagreement is «whether the true body and blood of Christ are
bodily in the bread and wine». (Z VI/II 522. 22–24, 523. 12–27)

Faith, and Exposition of the Faith for the King of France in 1531, published
by Bullinger in 1536.

There were changes and developments as well as considerable continuity
in Zwingli’s understanding of the sacraments. 3 From the beginning his theol-
ogy  was  compatible  with  a  symbolic  interpretation  of  the  sacraments,
whether or not he had a symbolic view then or moved to that view from the
end of 1524. The subjective emphasis, which is a continuing element in his
theology, is also evident in his preference for memorial to testament. (How-
ever the stress on faith in all his works is not simply subjective, as faith is the
work of the Spirit.) Moreover, the emphasis on the community rather than
just the individual is present from an early stage, as is the conviction that the
sacraments are a public witness to a person’s membership of the church. At
one point, he spoke of the sacraments as our pledge or covenant with others
and with God, but later he spoke of God’s pledge or covenant with us. Orig-
inally he had related sacrament (meaning an oath) to God’s instituting some-
thing as surely as with an oath, but at the end of 1524 to our uniting with each
other in one body as with an oath. (Z II 120.23–30, III 348.17–22) Although
Zwingli challenged the radicals on the sacraments, especially baptism, it is
primarily in controversy with Lutheran and Roman views that he developed
his sacramental theology. That is also the context for understanding his ﬁnal
works.

These works offer in many ways the most positive presentation of Zwing-
li’s view of the sacraments, but there is still a strong emphasis on what he does
not hold. Thus the article on the sacraments in Account of the Faith begins, «I
believe,  indeed  I  know,  that  all  the  sacraments  are  so  far  from  conferring
grace that they do not even convey or dispense it.» (Z VI/II 803.5–6) The rea-
sons he offers are that grace is given by the Spirit alone, that the Spirit does
not need a channel or vehicle, and that scripture does not show that visible
things carry with them the Spirit, rather the reverse. (803.7–15) Zwingli in-
sists on the sovereignty of the Spirit, who blows where he wills. This means
that he cannot be bound to the sacraments. Rather people need the Spirit in
order to receive the sacrament. (803.22–804.16)

In several of his works Zwingli has to state what the sacraments are for, as
he has rejected the view that they bestow grace. Here he offers a threefold
deﬁnition of a sacrament as a sign of a sacred thing, a visible form of invisible
grace, and a public testimony. (805.6–10)

I have discussed Zwingli’s understanding of the sacraments in The Theology of Huldrych
Zwingli, Oxford 1986, 180–93. See also W. P. Stephens, The Soteriological Motive in the Eu-
charistic  Controversy,  in:  Willem van’t  Spijker (ed.),  Calvin:  Erbe  und  Auftrag,  Kampen
1991, 203–213. A notable change is that in his early works he held that the sacraments conﬁrm
faith, something which he later rejected.

The Sacraments in the Confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566 – Bullinger’s Understanding

There is ﬁrst the traditional deﬁnition of a sacrament as a sign of a sacred
thing,  but  Zwingli  refers  to  grace  which  has  been  given  and  not  to  grace
which is being given. Although the sacraments cannot bestow grace, they as-
sociate visibly with the church those who before have been received into it
invisibly.  Thus  by  baptism  people  testify  that  they  belong  to  the  church.
(805.6–7,14–22) Zwingli rejects as a return to Judaism the view that the out-
ward use of the sacraments cleanses people inwardly, for according to Isaiah
and  Jeremiah  «the  promises  and  beneﬁts  of  God  are  given  by  God’s  free
goodness and not because of merits or outward ceremonies». (805.23–29)

His discussion of the eucharist begins positively with the afﬁrmation that
the true body of Christ is present by the contemplation of faith. This, how-
ever,  is  interpreted  in  terms  of  Christ’s  saving  death  for  us.  It  means  that
«everything done by Christ becomes as it were present to them by the con-
templation  of  faith».  In  an  extended  discussion  Zwingli  rejects  both  the
bodily  presence  of  Christ’s  body  and  the  bodily  eating  of  his  body.
(806.6–17) (In his controversy with Luther Zwingli has contrasted two ways
of salvation: faith in Christ or bodily eating.) He supports his position from
the Bible and the fathers, arguing that «as the body cannot be fed by a spiri-
tual substance, neither can the soul be fed by a bodily substance». (810.9) He
holds with Augustine that Christ is present everywhere according to his di-
vinity, but not according to his humanity. He insists in the light of the ascen-
sion that Christ’s body is in heaven, but by analogy with the sun his body can
be in one place, while his power pervades all things. Then, in the light of John
6:63 («the ﬂesh is of no avail»), he insists that bodily eating is of no avail, un-
like spiritual eating, which gives life. 4 For Zwingli this and similar texts show
that «This is my body» is to be interpreted ﬁguratively. Moreover, if bodily
eating gave forgiveness of sins, then Christ would have died in vain. Faith in
God through Jesus Christ or spiritual eating cleanses the soul, not the eating
of the sacrament. (807.1–19, 809.12–16, 28–30, 810.13–15, 812.3–6)

Eck  attacks  Zwingli  and  his Account  of  the  Faith  in  detail.  Zwingli
replies swiftly, but his letter is addressed to the princes of Germany and not
to the emperor. 5 It focuses on two key points and – with Bucer’s encour-
agement – does so positively. 6 They are «that the sacraments do not confer

4

The ﬁrst part of the text «It is the Spirit who gives life» seems to be less emphasized in the
later Zwingli.
Blanke argues that Zwingli wrote to the princes because he feared the emperor’s military in-
tervention (Z VI/III 245).
Bucer interpreted Zwingli’s understanding of the sacraments positively in 1536, when his
views were regarded as essentially Lutheran. «Christ alone effects the whole of salvation in
us, and he does it not by some other power, but by his Spirit alone. However, for this he uses
with us the word, both the visible word in the sacraments and the audible word in the gospel.
By them he brings and offers remission of sins .. . . Zwingli recognized that; hence, when he

or dispense grace» and «that in the holy supper of the Lord Christ’s natural
body is not eaten». (Z VI/III 252.16–253.1) Zwingli develops his position,
while afﬁrming what he has already said. He deﬁnes a sacrament in terms
of the sign and the thing signiﬁed. In baptism what is signiﬁed is belonging
to the Church, though Zwingli refers also to washing and regeneration, and
in the eucharist to giving thanks for Christ and his death for us. (253.8–10,
254.4–8, 258.9–10)

Zwingli now makes use of the senses to present a more positive view of
the  sacraments. 7  The  sacraments  do  not  confer  grace.  However,  when  we
contemplate the things which they signify, the sacraments in a way present
them to our eyes and senses and enable them to penetrate to the mind, for
Zwingli says that the mind works most freely when not distracted by the
senses. He adds emphatically, however, that it is the Spirit who leads the way.
(260.7–261.3, 262.2–4) For Zwingli only the Spirit, not something outward
such as a sacrament, can reach the mind or heart or soul.

Zwingli speaks positively of the sacraments in supporting and restoring
our faith, as in them we have a living and speaking invitation to contemplate
God, and then of the necessity to have the Holy Spirit beforehand. This leads
him to ask whether the sacraments are in vain? He afﬁrms: «For they [the
sacraments] proclaim salvation given by God, turn the senses to it, and exer-
cise faith which they promise also to the neighbour, and draw to brotherly
love. And one and the same Spirit effects all these things, who draws some-
times without, sometimes with, the instrument... .» (270.6–15, 271.7–12) He
later  refers  to  contemplation  and  participation  by  faith  as  the  one  thing
which is necessary in the sacraments. In the eucharist «the body of Christ is
the more present to the mind by the contemplation of faith the greater is the
faith and the love of Christ». (281.16–20,24–25)

The sacraments are related somewhat ambiguously both to faith and to
the Holy Spirit. Zwingli does not state that what is signiﬁed is offered to us
regardless of our faith nor that the Holy Spirit uses the sacraments and makes
them effective for us.

In Exposition of the Faith Zwingli refers to the sacraments initially in the
opening chapter on «God and His Worship», with its stress on putting our
trust in the creator and not the creature. God has not given to created things
power to forgive sins. 8 He also stresses that sacraments signify things which

denied that the sacraments dispense grace, he meant that the sacraments, that is the outward
action, are not of themselves effective, but that everything belonging to our salvation depends
on the inward action of Christ, of whom the sacraments are, in their way, instruments.» (In
sacra quatuor evangelia, Enarrationes perpetuae, [Basel, 1536] p. 485 B)
Zwingli had spoken of the sacraments and senses earlier, but not in this way. See Stephens,
Theology 182–83.
This is an important emphasis in Zwingli from the beginning. (Z II 217.14)

Zwingliana XXXIII, 2006

The Sacraments in the Confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566 – Bullinger’s Understanding

have been done and which we ought to do. Thus baptism signiﬁed both that
Christ has washed us by his blood and that we ought to put him on. (Z VI/V
59.15–19,60.1–6) Zwingli insists on the presence of Christ in the supper, as-
serting that it is not the Lord’s Supper, if Christ is not present. This is con-
ﬁrmed by Christ’s word «Where two or three are gathered in my name, there
am I in the midst of them», to which Zwingli adds, «How much more is he
present where the whole church is gathered?» (90.14–17)

Interestingly Zwingli recognizes that his attacks on views which ascribe
too much to the sacraments raise the question whether the sacraments have
any virtue. The chapter entitled «The Seven Virtues of the Sacraments» is his
response to this. The sacraments, he says, are instituted and used by Christ;
bear witness to an accomplished fact; take the place of the things they signify,
whence they also get their names; signify sublime things; have an analogy
with what they signify; bring increase and support to faith through their ap-
peal to the senses; and ﬁll the ofﬁce of an oath of allegiance. (155.11–161.18)
The exposition of the sixth virtue (158.12–160.27) is as long as all the rest. It is
through the senses that Satan attacks, but in the sacraments the senses are en-
listed in the service of faith, and so they aid faith.

Earlier Zwingli used sacramental eating of merely outward eating without
faith in the heart. (Z VI/II 812.3–6) In Exposition of the Faith, however, he
uses it for an eating of the sacrament with faith, when people do inwardly
what they represent outwardly. (Z VI/V 149.15–150.7 and 92.17–93.1) He in-
sists that only the Holy Spirit gives faith. What the sacraments give is histori-
cal faith, which they give to believer and unbeliever alike. (151.10–152.1) For
Zwingli Christ is present according to his divine nature, his body being in
heaven. However, he has already interpreted this positively with the analogy
of the sun. Its body is in one place, but its power pervades all things. (Z VI/II
807.17–19)

Zwingli’s understanding of the sacraments is related to his theology as a
whole, in particular his understanding of God. God is central to his theology
and he challenged teaching and practice which obscured this. From this arose
his opposition to placing one’s trust in created things, such as the sacraments,
rather than in God, the creator. For him medieval teaching and practice led
people to put their faith in the sacraments and not in God. Moreover, that
teaching and practice were in conﬂict with Zwingli’s emphasis on the sover-
eignty of God in salvation, redemption in Christ alone, and the freedom of
the Spirit to act where and how he wills. The underlying neo-platonism in
Zwingli’s  theology  also  inﬂuenced  his  attitude  to  the  sacraments  with  his
conviction that what is outward (the sacrament) cannot affect the inward (the
soul).  His  controversy  with  Roman  and  Lutheran  views  led  to  a  negative
presentation of what the sacrament does not do and therefore on the need for
faith in our receiving rather than on the grace of God in giving. Moreover, the

Zwingliana XXXIII, 2006

55

Peter Stephens

emphasis on memorial and thanksgiving placed the accent on what God has
done in Christ, not on what he is now doing through him.

From his late works we may note some of the central elements in Zwing-

li’s sacramental theology.

The sacrament is deﬁned in terms of the sign and the thing signiﬁed, but
with a sharp distinction between the two. This leads often to a contrast be-
tween the inward and the outward, rather than a relating of them. What is
signiﬁed refers sometimes to the church, sometimes to Christ and to what he
has done, and its being called to mind.

The sacrament does not confer grace, but it is a sign of or testimony to

grace already given.

Only the Spirit, and not the sacrament, gives faith. It can give only histori-
cal faith. It is necessary therefore to have faith before receiving the sacrament.
Spiritual eating depends on such faith.

Faith is so fundamental to his theology that it often appears that the real-
ity of what is signiﬁed by the sacraments and not simply its reception is de-
pendent on faith.

The sacrament in itself does not give or increase faith. However, the senses
to which the sacrament appeals can at least indirectly aid faith. Moreover, we
have sacraments because of our senses.

The Spirit is sometimes, though not unequivocally, related to the sacra-
ments. The freedom of the Spirit means that the Spirit does not need the sac-
raments and is not bound by them. It is the same Spirit who effects all things
and who draws sometimes without, sometimes with, the instrument. (Z VI/
III 271.10–12) 9

The presence of Christ in the eucharist is afﬁrmed, as is the presence of the
true  body  and  blood.  However,  Zwingli  denies  both  bodily  presence,  as
Christ’s body is in heaven, and bodily eating, as the ﬂesh is of no avail.

Christ’s feeding the soul in the sacrament is expressed by analogy with the

feeding of the body by the bread.

Christ’s presence in the eucharist is on occasion, though not generally, re-
lated to the Spirit, but this is not developed by Zwingli as it is by others. 10
In both sacraments there is a continuing emphasis on the church and on

the sacrament as a testimony to membership of the church.

Zwingli accommodates himself at least in the words he uses, in the hope of
agreement, as, for example, in his reply to Eck, yet he also shows impatience
with the search for formulas which unite him with Luther, but only out-

The marginal note in the German text was «Alle würckung der usserlichen zeychen kumpt

pascens ﬁdeles . . .» (S VI/I 758.33–35).

wardly. He is also critical of the Tetrapolitan Confession, with its reference
to  Christ’s  truly  giving  his  true  body  as  food  for  the  soul.  (Z XI
340.24–341.8)

There are elements in Zwingli’s theology, which could possibly have been
developed by him, but which were developed later by others. Zwingli fre-
quently refers to God’s use of means without compromising God’s sover-
eignty, and this could have been afﬁrmed more positively without denying
God’s freedom to act. (S VI/I 609.5–11,729.24–28 and Z VI/III 120.20–24)
He could have used the doctrine of election to afﬁrm what God does in the
sacraments, again without compromising God’s sovereignty. The analogy of
ﬁre in the ﬂint, when it is struck, might have led to a more positive statement
of Christ’s presence than in its use in the letter to Thomas Wyttenbach. It is
followed by a reference to Christ’s being under the form of bread only when
he  is  sought  in  faith.  (Z VIII  88.6–10)  Zwingli  refers  to  the  Holy  Spirit’s
drawing sometimes without and sometimes with the sacrament, but does not
develop the second of these. It could have led to a stronger sense of what God
gives  in  the  sacraments.  Moreover,  he  speaks  of  the  Spirit’s  drawing  our
hearts up to heaven. This is not said about the eucharist, but it coheres with
what Calvin and Bullinger were to say. (SVI/II 74.28–33)

2 The First Helvetic Confession

Bullinger succeeded Zwingli in 1531 and in the following years strongly de-
fended Zwingli’s life and teaching. 11 Although his theology was similar to
Zwingli’s, he became a reformer independently of Zwingli. (Indeed the in-
ﬂuences on him included the works of Luther and Melanchthon.) He also
came to his understanding of the sacraments independently of Zwingli. Even
though he and Zwingli both had a broadly symbolic view of the sacraments,
their thinking on them was shaped in part by different people and different
texts. 12

Zwingli’s death left many unresolved problems for the church in Zurich,
including  relations  with  Luther.  Division  from  him  became  an  increasing
challenge, both theological and political, in the 1530s. It was focussed in the
differences over the sacraments. Neither the Swiss nor the Germans seemed

11 Opponents of the reformation in Switzerland used Zwingli’s and Oecolampadius’ teaching
on the sacraments to account for their death and the defeat at Kappel. Concern to defend that
teaching is evident in the sub-title and text of his reply to John Faber in 1532. See pages A
3v-5v and C 2v-4r. For the full title, see HBBibl 1 No. 35.

able to grasp the fundamental concerns of the other or to ﬁnd a way forward.
Martin  Bucer  came  close  to  success  in  mediating  between  them. 13  In  the
1530s he was in contact with both groups, and there were occasions, such as
the First Helvetic Confession, when there seemed to be a breakthrough. Ul-
timately, however, his efforts failed.

Peter Stephens

Bullinger’s correspondence reveals some of the concerns which lie behind
the Confession. While Bucer presses the need to satisfy Luther, Bullinger in-
sists  that  his  statements  must  be  acceptable  in  Zurich  and  not  Saxony
(HBBW 6.593–94). He afﬁrms the continuity of his teaching with that of
Zwingli and Oecolampadius (2.158.193–99; 4. 370.3–371.9). (Bucer also ar-
gues that what he proposes was accepted by Zwingli and Oecolampadius. 14)
Bullinger’s publishing of Zwingli’s Exposition of the Faith in the weeks fol-
lowing the Confession may reﬂect his concern to show his ﬁdelity to Zwingli
to those thinking that too many concessions had been made. Often in the
1530s Bullinger states that he has difﬁculty with words such as instrument
and exhibit. To him the word instrument seems to make the sacraments ef-
fective regardless of the faith of the recipient and the word exhibit seems to
ascribe  power  to  the  minister  or  the  sacrament  rather  than  to  God.
(4.378.15–379.24, 423.37–42; 5.101.14–102.2) It is signiﬁcant that in the First
Helvetic Confession it is not the sacraments which exhibit but God, while
the word instrument is not used.

Bullinger’s relations with Bucer changed over the years. Thus he was criti-
cal of the idea of a concord in a letter of 12 July 1532. (2.153–160) Yet in 1534
he responded positively to him and was prepared to accept obscure and am-
biguous expressions such as «exhibere, offerre, uniri, naturaliter, corporaliter
et alia nonnulla». Underlying this acceptance was his conviction that Bucer
was on their side. Moreover, the words were capable of a mild interpretation.
(4.379.32–38)  In  March  1535,  however,  Bullinger  asserts  that  even  with  a
hundred meetings they could not go beyond their Zurich Confession (1534)
unless persuaded by very clear scriptures. (5.170.32–34) After Bucer’s part in
the First Helvetic Confession, however, Bullinger thanked him for his excep-
tional care for the church in Zurich. (6.131. 2–3)

Behind the First Helvetic Confession there are other confessional state-
ments of some of the Swiss Churches, such as the Bern articles (1532) 15, the

The Sacraments in the Confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566 – Bullinger’s Understanding

Zurich Confession (1534), and the First Basel Confession (1534) 16. Each of
them to some degree points forward to the agreement in 1536. The Zurich
Confession makes several positive points. «The true body of Christ .. . is truly
present, given, and distributed to believers.» The sacraments which were in-
stituted by the Lord are «signs and testimonies of divine grace». «They not
only signify the divine promises but also in their way bring and represent
them to the senses.» (4.422.8–15, 425.98–99) They are not empty signs of an
absent rather than of a present Christ – something those in Zurich have never
taught. Christ makes himself present to his own. (423.31–32,40–41)

In the Confession phrases such as eating the body or ﬂesh of Christ are
given a Zwinglian interpretation. It is said that they are to be understood as
meaning to be persuaded through the Spirit and faith and ﬁrmly to believe
that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was cruciﬁed for us. (424.68–70) This eat-
ing and drinking are not limited to the sacrament. We eat his true body truly
when we believe with true faith his true body to be given for our salvation.
There is no other presence or eating of the body and blood of Christ than the
true  and  spiritual  one  and  no  other  eating  of  the  body  than  that  which
happens  truly  and  through  faith.  God  did  not  institute  the  sacraments  in
vain.  However,  for  unbelievers,  without  faith,  the  sacraments  are  useless.
(424.83–90,  425.95–96)  Besides  the  characteristic  Zwinglian  emphasis  on
faith, spiritual eating, and the sacrament as a memorial (426.137–41), there is
the insistence on God’s not being bound by the sacraments, and on the sac-
raments’ not being instruments and channels through which grace is poured
into  unbelievers,  on  the  Spirit’s  effecting  everything,  and  on  the  Spirit’s
drawing sometimes without the instrument, sometimes with. Created things
can  do  nothing.  (426.152–427.179)  These  Zwinglian  statements  inevitably
qualify the positive earlier statements and the later afﬁrmation of the sacra-
ments  as  a  tremendous  and  joyful  mystery  in  which  Christ  is  present.
(428.203–207)

The First Helvetic Confession is introduced as «a common confession of
the  holy,  true,  and  ancient  Christian  faith»  as  well  as  a  confession  of  the
Swiss churches. It involved the civic leaders as well as the reformers who
were driven by political as well as theological concerns. It arose both from
the Swiss endeavour to establish understanding and communion with Lu-

(abbreviated Müller). The Bern Synod has expressions which reﬂect the concern to ﬁnd ac-
commodation with Lutherans, however they are interpreted (e.g. Müller 45.25–32). See G. W.
Locher, Die Sakramentslehre des Berner Synodus, in: G. W. Locher (ed.), Der Berner Syn-
odus von 1532, Neukirchen-Vluyn 1988, Vol 2, 219–34.

16 The Basel Confession relates Christ’s presence to faith but also speaks of the true body and
blood as being offered with the bread and wine. It refers to Christ’s body as having ascended
and to our adoring Christ in heaven rather than in the sacrament of his body and blood.

therans  and  from  their  need  to  have  a  statement  of  faith  for  the  expected
council.

It is natural for a confession with an ecumenical concern to have a positive
character: to emphasise what one believes rather than what one rejects, to use
words and ideas which accommodate the criticisms of others, but also to in-
clude safeguards and qualiﬁcations to disarm those who are most opposed to
the others. The First Helvetic Confession has this ecumenical character and
consequently manifests continuity as well as discontinuity with Zwingli. It
was not the sole work of Bullinger, but he was one of the group who drafted
it. Besides the fundamental work of the Swiss in producing the text, there was
the role of Bucer and Capito. They arrived when it was complete and pro-
posed  amendments  to  it,  undoubtedly  strengthening  its  ecumenical  char-
acter.

The confession has 27 articles, of which only three explicitly concern the
sacraments. 17 What is most striking about them is their essentially positive
language about the sacraments and their afﬁrmation of what God does in
them. God is the subject of the sacraments. They are signs of divine grace.
The  articles  speak  differently  from  Zwingli  of  what  the  Lord  does  in  the
sacraments. Thus, «baptism is a bath of regeneration which the Lord offers
and  presents  to  his  elect  with  a  visible  sign». 18  In  the  Lord’s  Supper  «the
Lord truly offers his body and blood, that is himself, to his own and en-
ables them to enjoy such fruit that he lives ever more and more in them and
they in him». (Schaff 225, Müller 107.12–15) 19 These articles are in keeping
with  the  article  on  Ministers.  It  states  that  ministers  are  co-workers
through  whom  «God  imparts  and  offers  to  those  who  believe  in  him  the
knowledge of himself and the forgiveness of sins» 20. But it adds, and this is
later  applied  to  the  sacraments,  «in  all  things  we  ascribe  all  efﬁcacy  and
power to God the Lord alone» and not to something created; and he «dis-
penses  it  to  those  he  chooses  according  to  his  free  will».  (Schaff  219–20,
Müller 105.7–12)

17 Articles 20–22, also numbered 21–23. For the editions, see HBBibl I Nos. 659–84. For the
Latin text, see H. B. Smith and Philip Schaff (eds.), The Creeds of the Evangelical Protestant
Churches,  London  1877,  211–31.  For  the  German  text,  see  Müller,  Bekenntnisschriften
101–109.

18 The  Latin  text  has  «exhibeat»,  but  the  German  text  «anbietet  und  darstellt»  (Schaff  224,

Müller 107.5).

19 After stating that the sacraments are not bare signs, the German text describes them as con-
sisting of signs and essential (substantial) things, whereas the Latin text says that they consist
«at  the  same  time  (my  italics)  of  the  signs  and  the  things  (signiﬁed)»  (Schaff  223,  Müller
106.26–28). Then three times the word res is given in German as wesenlich and geystlich, again
showing the more Zwinglian character of the German text.

20 The Latin text has «administret» (Schaff 219), but the German text has «zuodienet und für-

treyt» (Müller 105.5–6).

The Sacraments in the Confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566 – Bullinger’s Understanding

These statements about what God does in the sacraments are qualiﬁed by
reference to God, election, and faith. The power is not in the sacraments or
the ministers but in God alone, and the sacraments are not fruitful automati-
cally, but only in the elect or in believers. Thus what is given in baptism is
given to the elect and what is given in the eucharist is given to «his own» or
believers. 21 Moreover, certain views of the bread and wine are explicitly ex-
cluded. Thus Christ’s body and blood are not naturally united with the bread
and wine nor spatially included in them. They are food not for the stomach,
but for eternal life. (Schaff 223–25, Müller 106.33–34, 41–43, 107.3–5, 12–14,
20–25, 108.1–2) It is important to note that the confession speaks about what
God does and not what the sacraments do. Thus on baptism it speaks not of
God’s using the sign but of his offering the bath of regeneration with a sign.
On the Lord’s Supper it refers to the bread and wine as signs through which
the communion of the body and blood of Christ are offered by the Lord
through the ministry of the church. Nevertheless, this section concludes by
ascribing the power to God alone and not to the sacraments. (Schaff 224–27,
Müller 107.2–5, 12–14, 19–22, 108.1–2)

The prolonged contact and correspondence with Bucer in the 1530s in the
endeavour to establish communion with Luther and the German churches
led to a more positive statement of the sacraments and to an accommodation
to  their  understanding  of  the  sacraments  or  at  least  to  a  language  which
would be acceptable to them. Some particular expressions probably reﬂect
Bucer’s inﬂuence, such as the use of true in article 22, where the Lord truly
offers his body and his blood and where the true communion of his body and
blood  is  administered  by  holy  and  true  signs,  and  also  the  reference  to
Christ’s offering his body and blood as Christ’s offering himself. 22 The refer-
ence to the elect in the ﬁrst part of the article on baptism probably comes
from Bucer. (Schaff 224–25, Müller 107.3, 12–22) 23 There are, of course, el-
ements  familiar  to  us  from  Zwingli:  the  ascription  of  all  power  to  God
(Schaff 220, 226–27, Müller 105.7–12, 108.1–2), the references to faith (Schaff
225,  Müller  106.34,  107.21,25),  the  basing  of  the  baptism  of  Christians’

21 There is no reference to believers in the Latin version. Where it has «exhibeatur», the German

text has «den glöubigen fürgetragen und dargebotten werde». (Schaff 225, Müller 107.21)

22 The reference to the signs as true is not in the Latin version.
23 The reference to election here and in the Zurich Agreement is characteristic of Bucer’s under-
standing of the sacraments, as is the role of the Holy Spirit in the Zurich Agreement. He re-
lates election to baptism as early as 1524. The role of the Spirit in the recipient is in part related
to election, as the Holy Spirit works only in the elect. The Spirit makes both the recipient
(elect children and believers) receptive and the sacrament effective, as the Lord «accomplishes
inwardly by the Spirit what is signiﬁed by the signs». Bucer speaks as well of the Holy Spirit
as the seal of divine grace, but also later of the sacraments as seals. See the discussion in W. P.
Stephens, The Holy Spirit in the Theology of Martin Bucer, Cambridge 1970, 213–59.

children  on  their  membership  of  God’s  people  and  on  God’s  word  about
them and election of them (Schaff 224, Müller 107.5–9), the reference to the
sacraments as signs of Christian fellowship (Schaff 224, Müller 106.36–38),
and the relating of the eucharist to remembering and giving thanks (Schaff
225–26,  Müller  104.23–25,  32–33).  Moreover,  the  last  part  is  effectively  a
summary of Zwingli’s Seven Virtues of the Sacraments, apart from the sec-
ond which says almost exactly the opposite of what Zwingli said. Interest-
ingly it is given as a response to the challenge of attributing too little to the
sacraments, as Zwingli’s original statement was a response to the challenge
whether – in the light of what he had written - the sacraments had any virtue.
(Schaff 226, Müller 107.34–44)

The presence of many Zwinglian emphases does not alter the fact that the ar-
ticles go beyond Zwingli’s statements. Yet this does not mean that Zwingli
could  not  have  agreed  to  the  Confession,  given  the  developments  in  his
understanding of the sacraments and the safeguards in the Confession. The
Confession, however, unlike much in Zwingli is an afﬁrmation of what the
sacraments are rather than a repudiation of what they are not, and it states in
various ways what God offers and imparts in them. Luther’s positive, though
critical, response to the Latin text is, therefore, not surprising.

3 The Zurich Agreement (1549)

Political as well as theological inﬂuences led to the Zurich Agreement. 24 Cal-
vin needed Zurich’s and therefore Bullinger’s support in his relations with
Bern and in his concern to help French Protestants through a Swiss alliance
with France. Moreover, both Bullinger and Calvin saw the need for an agree-
ment in the light of the Council of Trent and the Augsburg Interim. (In 1548

The Sacraments in the Confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566 – Bullinger’s Understanding

the imperial army reached Constance, only miles from Zurich.) Nevertheless
the detailed discussion between Bullinger and Calvin and Bullinger’s unhur-
ried approach, even with the army at Constance, show that political factors
were not decisive. An agreement between them was not certain. Bullinger
was strong in his defence of Zwingli, of whom Calvin had written critically.
Calvin, moreover, was perceived as a Lutheran, and he was also a friend of
Bucer, who was suspect in Zurich.

The  failure  of  the  First  Helvetic  Confession  to  achieve  the  expected
understanding  with  Luther  had  irrevocably  damaged  Swiss  relations  with
Bucer. 25 Swiss endeavours to establish communion with Luther had met with
rebuffs, which reached their climax in Luther’s Brief Confession. 26 In it he at-
tacked them as «fanatics and enemies of the sacrament» (WA 54.141.19) and
as  «murderers  of  souls  .. .  with  hearts  totally  possessed  by  the  devil»
(147.33–34), and referred to Zwingli’s becoming «totally a heathen» in Ex-
position of the Faith. (143.15–16)

It is not surprising that Luther’s attack on «their blasphemous and deceit-
ful heresy» (141.26) led to a vigorous defence of Zwingli and Oecolampa-
dius. The defence was, however, that of the Zurich ministers, even if written
by Bullinger. 27 It has a Zwinglian character with the centrality of remem-
brance  and  a  strong  emphasis  on  faith.  Yet  there  are  divergences  from
Zwingli. Thus, although remembering appears to be our remembering, yet
the summary states that in the church the Lord holds his suffering and our
redemption in fresh remembrance (78v). Again, although it is their faith in
Christ which feeds believers and makes them participants in God’s grace and
forgiveness and communion with Christ (71v), yet in communion an unbe-
liever may become a believer and then share in Christ (73r).

After replying to Luther in True Confession, Bullinger presented his view
in On the Sacraments and gave a copy to Calvin. This began a dialogue with
Calvin, which led to the Zurich Agreement. 28 As each in turn criticized the

25

In 1537 Bullinger opined that there seemed no end to confessions, as he mentioned seven at-
tempts by Bucer to secure agreement with the Swiss (HBBW 7. 293.10–294.27). Moreover,
with  his  retractions  and  his  acceptance  of  the  Augsburg  Confession  Bucer  appeared  Lu-
theran.

26 For the text, see: D. Martin Luthers Werke, Kritische Gesamtausgabe (Weimar, 1883– ). Bizer
(Studien 229–33) outlines some of Luther’s comments on Zwingli and the Swiss from 1539 to
his «derb und hart» Brief Confession, noting that Luther did not change his position by a
hair’s breadth. Then he concludes, «Die Konkordie ist am Zwinglianismus der Schweizer ge-
scheitert»!

27 For the editions, see HBBibl I Nos. 161–69. For the text, see No. 161. Bucer commenting on
this work refers to the memorial of an absent Christ. See Traugott Schiess (ed.), Briefwechsel
der Brüder Ambrosius und Thomas Blaurer 1509–1548, Freiburg 1908 and 1910, vol. 2, 358.

references to Zwingli. He notes that Calvin was inﬂuenced by Luther in his critical comments

statements of the other, their emphases and concerns become clear. Calvin
offered  a  substantial  critique  of  Bullinger’s  work  (CO 40.480–489).  For
example,  to  Calvin  Bullinger’s  statements  implied  Christ’s  absence  rather
than his presence, separated the sign and what it signiﬁed, denied that the sac-
raments offer what they signify, and rejected the use of instruments. In re-
sponse, Calvin insisted on the presence of Christ through the power of the
Spirit, though he is in heaven (481), on God’s truthfulness and therefore the
unity of the sign and what it signiﬁes (482), on God’s effecting at the same
time in us what he represents by the sign (482), on God’s using the sacra-
ments as instruments without their taking anything from God (485). This
critique led to silence on Bullinger’s part and it was months before contact
was renewed and the issues were discussed again. An eirenical letter setting
out  Calvin’s  views  led  Bullinger  to  identify  26  points  for  comment.
(CO 35.693–700) Through correspondence, Bullinger’s preferred method of
dialogue, they came to a closer understanding.

The central issues can be focussed in the use of certain words: exhibit, in-
strument, through, and at the same time. Bullinger disputed the statement
that Calvin did not bind grace to the sacraments by reference to Calvin’s as-
sertions that what is ﬁgured in the sacraments is exhibited to the elect and
that those receiving baptism at the same time receive forgiveness of sins. To
Bullinger Calvin does not differ from the papists who teach that the sacra-
ments confer grace on all who receive them. (693) Bullinger objected to the
use of through as seeming to attribute something to inanimate signs and pro-
posed «God acts and works in the hearts of the faithful while (dum) the sac-
raments are received» instead of «God works through the sacraments» (694).
Bullinger also challenged Calvin’s statement that «the sacraments are instru-
ments of the grace of God». It seemed to attribute something to the sacra-
ments, unless instrument means sign. It is God who confers grace and the
gifts of salvation. It is he who exhibits these things (not, as Calvin says, the
sacraments), and he does so through the Holy Spirit and faith, faith being the
gift of God through which we receive his gifts. (695) Bullinger can accept

on Zwingli’s earlier sacramental views. He approved, however, of Zwingli’s rejection of the
bodily presence, while disapproving his failure to afﬁrm the presence of Christ or commu-
nion with him. Calvin appears not to have read Zwingli’s later views, but to have accepted
others’ positive interpretation of them, and referred to them mistakenly as if they were the
same as his. For Calvin’s critique of Zwingli and Luther, see for example A Short Treatise on
the Lord’s Supper (1541) in: Calvin: Theological Treatises (trans. J. K. S. Reid; London 1954),
163–66. Usteri (pp. 734, 741) attributes too much to the inﬂuence of Calvin, regarding Bul-
linger as simply Zwinglian before his contact with Calvin. See J. M. Usteri, Vertiefung der
Zwinglischen Sakraments- und Tauﬂehre bei Bullinger, in: Theologische Studien und Kri-
tiken 65 (1883) 730–58. For the correspondence with Calvin and the Bern Articles, see W.
Baum, E. Cunitz, and E. Reuss (eds.), Ioannis Calvini Opera quae supersunt omnia (Corpus
Reformatorum Vols. 29–87) (Brunswick and Berlin, 1863–1900) (abbreviated as CO).

The Sacraments in the Confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566 – Bullinger’s Understanding

Calvin’s statement that the sign is not empty, if that means not useless, but
not if it means that the sign contains what it represents. (700) 29

In reply (C0 35.701–704) Calvin defended and explained his position, not
least the role of the Spirit, election, and God’s faithfulness, and challenged
some of Bullinger’s statements. He drew on the New Testament in rejecting
the  opposition  in  Bullinger  between  God  and  the  role  of  instruments
(702–703), and also Bullinger’s apparent view that if God acts then instru-
ments cease (703–704). The Holy Spirit uses the sacrament as an instrument,
but is the author of what is given. The effectiveness of the sacraments is re-
lated to God’s truthfulness, for God would appear to deceive in his prom-
ises, if believers did not receive what is offered in the sacraments. (702) (Cal-
vin explained that simul was used in the sense of similiter [similarly].) (704)
He  distinguished  his  position  from  that  of  the  papists,  as  unlike  them  he
held that not all but only the elect receive what the sacraments offer. The
whole effect depends on election and the sign is useless unless God works in
us through his Spirit. (701) Calvin does not regard the sacraments as con-
taining what they ﬁgure literally, but in the sense that the Lord performs in-
wardly by the power of his Spirit what is testiﬁed by the outward sign. (707)
Calvin notes Bullinger’s reference to the eucharistic signs as commemorating
the one-for-all sacriﬁce of Christ for us, but also his neglect of the daily of-
fering of Christ to us that we may be one with him. The body sacriﬁced for
us is daily food for us. (705) There is a repeated stress on communion with
Christ. (705–708) 30

Bullinger  responds  positively  to  Calvin’s  comments  (CO 35.  709–716),
but without changing what he held on the sacraments as means of grace – «all
good things are conferred on us through the Spirit of God, received through
faith, and sealed by the sacraments». (713) He insists that it is God who «ex-
hibits his gifts to us through his Spirit», while «the sacraments offer them to
us sacramentally and so represent and seal them». (709) He argues that the in-
struments do not cease because God alone acts, but what God alone does
they do not do. (712) Interestingly in his comments on the ﬁrst point, Bul-
linger  ignores  the  fundamental  term  election,  which  Calvin  says  distin-
guishes his position from the papists, and speaks rather of the faith of com-
municants. He allows that «because of the faith of the communicant there is a
certain conjunction of the grace of God and the sacraments». (709)

The Zurich Agreement, with its 26 articles, is wholly concerned with the
sacraments, whereas only three of the First Helvetic Confession’s 27 articles
concern the sacraments. Its clear focus is Christ. It states that one must start

from Christ and salvation, if one is to speak comprehensively about the sac-
raments, as they are appendices of the gospel. (Müller 159.27–29)

The explicit presentation of the sacraments begins signiﬁcantly with spiri-
tual communion to which the sacraments testify. (160.23–28) This and the
following article have many characteristically Zwinglian emphases – with the
sacraments as badges of Christian profession, inciting us to thanksgiving, ex-
ercising faith, appealing to our senses, and recalling the death of Christ to our
memory. (160.29–39) There are also Zwinglian emphases in other articles: the
role  and  necessity  of  faith  (161.3–4,  12–14,  162.1–2),  receiving  spiritually
(161.4), the power belonging to God, working by his Spirit, and not to the
sacraments  (161.20–26),  the  distinction  between  the  sign  and  what  it  sig-
niﬁes, so that the latter is not in or attached to the sign (163.23–28), the ﬁgu-
rative interpretation of «This is my body» (162.43–163.2), the rejection of a
local presence, transubstantiation, consubstantiation, and the adoration of
the  sacrament  (162.36–41,  163.9–14,  23–28),  and  the  seeking  of  Christ  in
heaven (162.38–40).

Several important elements in the Agreement, however, are not present in
Zwingli and some are not present in the First Helvetic Confession or not in
the same way. In the Agreement as in the Confession the sign and what it sig-
niﬁes (the substance) are not separated from each other, but in the Agreement
this is made explicit. In keeping with the Confession article 8 states that the
Lord truly presents what the sacraments truly ﬁgure (160.40), and article 9
adds  that  the  sign  and  the  things  signiﬁed  are  distinct,  but  not  disjoined
(161.1–3). This positive relationship between the sign and the thing signiﬁed
is expounded in terms of the sacraments as seals and the promise contained in
them. As the sacraments are seals of God’s grace, there is no doubt that God
grants us within by his Spirit what they ﬁgure to our senses. (160.41–43, cf.
162.8). 31 What is new here is the role of the Spirit, which is surprisingly ab-
sent from the earlier Confession.

In the sacrament the emphasis is on the promise not the sign, for it is the
ofﬁce of the promise to lead us to Christ. (A contrast is made between the
promise and a bare sign. Indeed, separated from Christ, the sacraments are
nothing but empty masks.) (161.7–19) The stress on the promise is some-
thing which Bullinger and Calvin met in their reading of Luther, and it fea-
tures in both of them. Later the Agreement states that in the proper sense the
Spirit alone is the seal and not the sacrament (161.37–39), and that there is no
inherent virtue in the sacrament, not even if we understand by that the prom-
ise  which  distinguishes  it,  «for  it  is  God  alone  who  acts  by  his  Spirit».
(161.20–23)

31 The Bern article states that the sacraments exhibit what they ﬁgure, whereas Bullinger rejects

this use of exhibit.

66

Zwingliana XXXIII, 2006

The Sacraments in the Confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566 – Bullinger’s Understanding

Article 13 (161.27–32) speaks of the sacraments as instruments 32 which
God uses and by which he acts efﬁcaciously. (The word is organum not, as in
the Bern articles, instrumentum.) But lest this be misunderstood, the article
at  once  states  that  the  sacraments,  like  ministers,  are  nothing  unless  God
makes  them  effective.  God  acts  efﬁcaciously  through  them,  but  certain
qualiﬁcations are made about the sacraments, the minister, and the recipient.
Such a balance is typical of Bullinger and of the Agreement. Thus God acts
where he pleases, and the power is his, it is not the sacrament’s or the min-
ister’s. (161.27–31) The gifts of God are offered to all, however not all par-
ticipants receive what is offered to them, but – according to articles 16 and 17
– only the elect, and they receive by the secret power of the Spirit. (162.6,
161.43–48, 162.4–5) 33 In article 18 people’s receiving depends on their faith;
nevertheless their faith does not affect what God offers in the sacrament, for
the sacraments always retain their power. (162.6–10) Faith is needed to re-
ceive the sacraments, yet at the same time it is stated that the sacraments also
nourish, conﬁrm, and increase faith. (161.37–39, 162.20–24) Article 15, how-
ever, has already afﬁrmed that the Spirit is the author and perfecter of faith
and that we may not ascribe to the sacraments anything which belongs to sal-
vation. (161.37–42) 34 Although these articles speak of the sacraments as in-
struments and aids, they afﬁrm «We agree therefore that it is Christ alone
who truly baptizes inwardly, and who in the supper makes us share in him».
(161.33–36)

The Zurich Agreement is neither Bullingerian nor Calvinian. Both would
have  expressed  their  views  differently,  but  both  could  afﬁrm  what  it  af-
ﬁrmed, even if offering their own interpretations. It could be described as a
Calvinian  view  expressed  within  the  constraints  imposed  by  Bullinger’s
theology or Bullinger’s view stretched to embrace Calvin’s. The correspon-
dence reveals their differences, for example, on the sacraments as instruments
or  as  exhibiting.  Yet  both  were  able  largely  to  accommodate  the  other’s
views, in substance if not in emphasis. 35 The fact that the Bern articles were

32 They are also described as helps, which is not typical of Bullinger. (161.25,35)
33 The Bern article, unlike article 16, uses exhibits «ut sacramenta illis solis exhibeant quod of-
ferunt» (CO 35.719). (The word exhibit is also omitted in article 8.) In article 17 he states that
only the elect receive the reality (veritas) of the signs and not the reprobate.

34 As they were not concerned with relations to Lutherans, the question of those without faith
merits only half a sentence. For them the use of the sacraments confers no more than if they
had abstained. It is rather destructive for them. By contrast the faithful who share in Christ in
the sacraments also share in him before and outside the sacraments, as one sees with Paul and
Cornelius. (162.12–19)
In replying to Bucer, Calvin implies that he would have been glad to have expressed more
clearly and fully the effect of the sacraments and what the Lord confers. (CO 41.439) The
agreement uses the word exhibit (in article 8) but not in relation to the sacrament, and it is not
included in article 16 despite its presence in the corresponding Bern article. Calvin accepts the

35

the basis of the agreement does not mean that Calvin’s views dominated, for
Gäbler  (  «Consensus  Tigurinus»  329)  rightly  observes  that  they  had  in-
ﬂuenced each other. The Calvin of the Bern articles was the Calvin who had
been in dialogue with Bullinger. Therefore, to give one example, he did not
include in them simul which Bullinger had earlier criticized. In an agreement
what is denied may be as important as what is afﬁrmed. The balancing of as-
sertion and qualiﬁcation does this here and enables the agreement to be mu-
tual.

Differences from Zwingli as well as similarities are evident in the agree-
ment. It is surprising, therefore, that both Bullinger and Calvin assert their
continuity with Zwingli and Oecolampadius. In 1554 the Zurich ministers
refer to Marburg and to what was agreed. They refer to the sacraments as fos-
tering and conﬁrming faith, «as organs through which God acts efﬁcaciously
in his elect». «God truly testiﬁes in them what he ﬁgures and at the same time
(simul) in a secret way presents and fulﬁls what he testiﬁes, joining to them
the efﬁcacy of his Spirit.» 36 They claim that after this was agreed at Marburg,
Luther still refused to give his hand to Zwingli and Oecolampadius. They
then  added,  after  quotations  from  them  both,  that  on  the  eucharist  they
taught as Calvin. (CO 43.276–278) Calvin asserted that they would not have
changed a word in the Agreement. (CO 37.11)

One may question whether Zwingli taught as Calvin taught, but it is still
possible to argue that Zwingli could have signed the Zurich Agreement. At
ﬁrst sight this may cause surprise, as some positive afﬁrmations about the
sacraments go beyond what Zwingli wrote. 37 However, key elements of his
theology are present and the qualiﬁcations added to non-Zwinglian state-
ments could well have satisﬁed him as they did Bullinger. Most importantly
the Agreement denied that the sacraments confer grace, rejected the bodily
presence and the bodily eating of Christ, and opposed trust in created things.
It afﬁrmed the centrality and necessity of faith, the sovereignty of the Spirit,
the distinction between the sign and what it signiﬁes, the eucharist as a testi-
mony and a memorial, the presence of Christ’s body in heaven, the ﬁgurative
interpretation of the words of institution, and the relevance of John 6:63.
There are elements in the agreement which are not Zwinglian, but in some
cases they are qualiﬁed in a Zwinglian way and in others his theology can be
interpreted or stretched to include them. Though he argues for Christ’s pres-

use of organum instead of instrumentum, although that is neutralised for Bullinger by the as-
sertion that all the power is of God. Bucer held, if not quite accurately, that the Zurich Agree-
ment contained no more than the First Helvetic Confession. (41.350–58)

36 The Marburg articles do not refer to the elect, nor to God’s offering and fulﬁlling at the same

time what he testiﬁes.

37 These include such statements as «The Lord truly presents what the sacraments truly ﬁgure»

(Müller 160.40) and «Thus in the supper Christ communicates himself to us» (162.18).

68

Zwingliana XXXIII, 2006

ence in terms of «where two or three are gathered in my name», yet else-
where he speaks of Christ as present and acting through his Spirit. (S VI/I
758.33–35) Though he stresses the distinction and not the conjunction of the
sign and what it signiﬁes and does not speak of the Holy Spirit’s making the
sacraments effective, yet he does say that «the same Spirit effects all these
things,  who  draws,  sometimes  without,  sometimes  with  the  instrument».
Though he sees the commemoration as referring to Christ’s death and the
sacrament as a sign of grace already given and not a sign of grace being given,
yet he uses analogy to interpret the sacraments («as bread sustains human life
. . . so Christ alone .. . sustains .. . the mind». [Z VI/V 158.1–3]). Though he
does not speak of faith’s being given in the sacrament, yet this is compatible
with what he says about the Spirit’s effecting all things. Though he does not
relate the effectiveness of the sacraments to the doctrine of election, yet his
doctrine of election could possibly be developed in this way.

4 The Second Helvetic Confession (1566)

The Second Helvetic Confession 38 differs from the other two. They were in
effect confessions of churches, with several authors, of whom Bullinger was
one. The Second Helvetic Confession was Bullinger’s personal confession,
which became a confession of Elector Frederick III of the Palatinate and also
of the Reformed Churches. As a part of Bullinger’s last will and testament, it
embodies the faith expressed in Bullinger’s ministry, but it also reﬂects the
conﬂict with Lutherans and the conclusion of the Council of Trent. It covers
the themes of the First Helvetic Confession in its 30 chapters, though in a dif-
ferent order and at much greater length.

Before the three chapters (19–21) on the sacraments 39, some elements of
Bullinger’s  sacramental  theology,  such  as  the  role  of  the  Spirit,  the  use  of
means, and the relation of the outward and inward, are clearly expounded.
Thus  in  the  ﬁrst  chapter  Bullinger  states  that  although  no  one  comes  to
Christ «unless he is inwardly enlightened by the Holy Spirit», yet «we know
that God wills the word of God to be preached outwardly as well». (Müller
171.22–23)  In  the  same  context  Bullinger  insists  that  «God  can  enlighten
whom and when he will, even without the outward ministry». (171.34–36)

terior, Neukirchen-Vluyn 1968, and Joachim Staedtke (ed.), Glauben und Bekennen, Zürich

mental teaching of the Confession. See J. C. McLelland, Die Sakramentslehre der Confessio
Helvetica Posterior, in: Staedtke (ed.), Glauben 368–91.

Later, after quoting John 6:44 and 1 Cor: 3.5–7, Bullinger makes his charac-
teristic  distinction  between  what  is  done  outwardly  and  what  is  done  in-
wardly.  «Let  us,  therefore,  believe  that  God  teaches  us  by  his  word  out-
wardly through his ministers and that he inwardly moves the hearts of his
elect to faith by the Holy Spirit», adding that all glory is to be given to God.
(200. 31–34) 40

The ﬁrst paragraph (205.29–40) which deﬁnes the sacraments gathers up
emphases from the earlier confessions. There is a clear statement that God
«seals his promises» and «performs inwardly the things he represents out-
wardly and so strengthens and increases our faith through the working of
God’s Spirit in our hearts». In the midst of these afﬁrmations, which are not
typical of Zwingli, there are Zwinglian references to the senses and to mem-
ory.  In  this  chapter  God  is  manifestly  the  subject  of  the  sacraments,  for
«Christ still works in the sacraments» and «God works in his own ordin-
ance». (206.15, 19) 41 Although the sacraments are not described in Calvinian
terms as instruments or means of grace, Bullinger moves towards this later
with the use of meanwhile (interim) in the statement «Outwardly bread is of-
fered by the minister .. . And meanwhile inwardly by the working of Christ
through the Holy Spirit they receive also the ﬂesh and blood of the Lord and
feed on them to eternal life.» (210.26–31) It is important for Bullinger not to
ascribe to the sacraments what belongs to God either by the use of a word
such as instrument or by making the sacrament the subject of the sentence.
This typically Zwinglian concern is constantly expressed by Bullinger’s as-
cribing all power to God.

There is in the article a balance typical of Bullinger. An afﬁrmation is often
balanced by a careful qualiﬁcation, and the disapproval of those who claim
too much is balanced by the disapproval of those who believe too little. Thus
Bullinger stresses the role of the minister in saying that «the faithful, when
they receive the sacraments from the ministers, know that God works in his
own ordinance». However, he adds that the minister gives the sign, while it is
the Lord who gives what it signiﬁes. (206.17–24)

Bullinger rejects the Roman view that the symbols are changed into what
they signify. But he balances this by asserting that the elements are not mere
bread and wine, but holy signs, for Christ «did not wish the faithful to re-

40 Koch (Theologie 318–20), Rorem (Calvin and Bullinger 382–83), and Dowey (p. 233) empha-
size the important relationship of outward and inward in the Confession. For Dowey, see Ed-
ward Dowey, Der theologische Aufbau des Zweiten Helvetischen Bekenntnisses, in: Staedtke
(ed.), Glauben 205–34. Walter Köhler, however, refers to their separation in Bullinger – see:
Dogmengeschichte als Geschichte des christlichen Selbstbewusstseins, Zürich 1951, 322.

41 Locher rightly observes, when commenting on this, that Christ is more strongly the subject
of the sacramental action in Bullinger than in Zwingli. G. W. Locher, Die Lehre vom Heiligen
Geist in der Confessio Helvetica Posterior, in: Staedtke (ed.) Glauben 327.

The Sacraments in the Confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566 – Bullinger’s Understanding

ceive only bread and wine .. . as they do at home, but also to communicate
spiritually in the things signiﬁed». (207.38–40, 44–208.3) Likewise Bullinger
disapproves both of those who attribute the sanctiﬁcation of the sacraments
to words spoken by the minister and of those who regard the sacraments as
superﬂuous, despising the signs because they already have what the signs sig-
nify. Similarly, he repudiates the Roman and Lutheran view that «grace and
the things signiﬁed are so bound to and included in the signs, that whoever
share in the sacraments outwardly also share in grace and the things signi-
ﬁed». But he balances this by afﬁrming that the character of those receiving
does not affect what God offers in the sacraments. The inﬂuence of Calvin is
evident in Bullinger’s insistence that the integrity of the sacraments does not
depend on the worthiness of the ministers or the faith of the recipients, but
«on the faith, truth, and sheer goodness of God». Our «unbelief does not in-
validate God’s faith», who offers us what the sacraments signify. Moreover,
in this passage Bullinger refers to God’s offering at the same time what is sig-
niﬁed in words. (208.19–32)

The chapters on baptism and communion cohere with that on the sacra-
ments. There is the parallel of what we do outwardly and what the Spirit does
inwardly (209.14–18, 210.23–26), with the use of the word meanwhile (in-
terim) on one occasion (210.28–31), the association of election with baptism
(208.46) 42  and  faith  with  communion  (e.g.  210.5),  and  the  use  of  analogy
(209.18–21, 211.11–14).

A detailed comparison between Zwingli’s later writings and this Confes-
sion reveals many elements common to both. 43 They include: the deﬁnition
of a sacrament in terms of the sign and the thing signiﬁed, and the distinction
between them, though Bullinger adds to them «the word» (205.33), the ref-
erence  to  the  senses  and  a  contrast  between  the  outward  and  the  inward
(205.36–37, 206.23–24, 208.16–18, 209.14–18, 210.23–31, 211.37–41), the use
of analogy (209.18–21, 211.10–19), a focus on the action rather than the el-
ements  (205.32),  the  role  of  faith  (205.37,  206.17,  40–41,  207.46,  208.1,3,
210.5, 11, 17–18, 28–30, 211.10, 19–20, 22–23, 28–29, 33–36, 39–42, 46–48,
212.2–3, 6, 8–10, 13–15, 36–38), and the use of spiritual or spiritually (206.41,
208.3, 209.21, 210.5, 17–18, 211.1–10, 28–29, 39, 45). With the eucharist there
are: the rejection of bodily presence and bodily eating and the afﬁrmation of
spiritual and sacramental eating (210.36–212.15), the role of John 6 and in
particular of John 6:63 (210.41–43, 211.12–19, 23–31), the understanding of

42 Koch’s assertion (Theologie 286) that baptism has «keine effektive Bedeutung», but is to be
understood in terms of the sacraments as «Erinnerungszeichen» appears to conﬂict with Bul-
linger’s understanding of election and the gift and work of the Holy Spirit. See, for example,
Müller 206.29–32, 208.42–45, 209.14–18.
Some elements, such as the sacraments of the Old and New Testament are not discussed, as
they were not matters of controversy.

43

Zwingliana XXXIII, 2006

the sacrament as thanksgiving and memorial (212.43–213.1) and a witness to
the church (212.3), the moral dimension of the sacrament and the sacrament
as an oath (209.22–29, 212.31–42).

But for all the similarities with Zwingli, there are important differences of
emphasis and some differences of substance. The Confession is fundament-
ally positive in its presentation of the sacraments, unlike Account of the Faith
and Letter to the Princes. It is primarily concerned with what the sacraments
are, not with what they are not. (Zwingli’s approach is more positive in Ex-
position of the Faith, though its emphasis is different from the Confession.)
The Confession emphasizes what God does (206.15, 18, 23–32). He is the
subject of the sacrament. Bullinger refers to God, or Christ, or Christ by his
Spirit acting in the sacraments (206.18, 15, 210.30–31) or to the Holy Spirit’s
acting in us (205.37–38, 206.30–31, 209.15). He speaks of God’s offering us
and Christ’s feeding us. (208. 22–32, 210.17–18) What God does inwardly is
related to as well as contrasted with what the minister or sacrament do out-
wardly. Sometimes there is an apparently temporal link, with the use of the
words  «meanwhile»  and  «at  the  same  time».  (208.22–29,  210.28–31)  This
more positive relating of what God does in the sacraments is expressed in
what Bullinger had drawn from Calvin about God’s truthfulness, so that the
sign is joined with what it signiﬁes, rather than as in Zwingli contrasted with
it. (208.21–33, 207.40–208.4, 19–32)

The role of the Holy Spirit is more clearly focussed in the Confession than
in Zwingli. The term spiritual is, at least on occasion, more clearly related to
the Holy Spirit than sometimes in Zwingli, and in John 6:63 there is a stress
on the second half, on the work of the Spirit, whereas in the later Zwingli the
stress was often on the ﬁrst half, on the ﬂesh not proﬁting. (211.11–19) Fur-
thermore,  Bullinger  uses  Zwingli’s  comparison  with  the  sun  to  illustrate
Christ’s presence, but develops it signiﬁcantly in terms of the Holy Spirit.
For  Zwingli,  the  sun’s  body  is  in  one  place,  while  its  power  pervades  all
things. (Z VI/II 807.17–19) But in this comparison Bullinger argues «how
much more is Christ .. . present with us spiritually», understanding «spiri-
tually» in terms of the Holy Spirit by reference to John 14–16. 44 (212.22–28)
In the later Zwingli the sacraments are said to increase faith, but this is re-
lated to their appeal to the senses. In the Confession this argument is not
used, though, of course, for both of them it is the Spirit who gives and in-
creases faith. (205.35–38) Bullinger, as Zwingli, wrestled with why sacramen-

44

72

In this context he uses, as Oecolampadius, Bucer, and Calvin, the phrase «sursum corda».
Bullinger  refers  to  lifting  our  eyes  to  heaven,  though  not  to  «sursum  corda»  in  1525–26.
(HBTS 2.105. 8–9, 115.1–2). References to the Holy Spirit could be simply to the fact that
Christ is not present now bodily, but in the Holy Spirit (HBTS 2.60.27–35).

Zwingliana XXXIII, 2006

The Sacraments in the Confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566 – Bullinger’s Understanding

tal  eating  is  necessary  if  one  has  eaten  spiritually. 45  He  goes  further  than
Zwingli in speaking of «receiving something» and one’s faith «being kindled
and growing more and more». (211.41–46) He uses election twice in relation
to circumcision and baptism, as in the First Helvetic Confession. This is not
typical of Zwingli’s use of election, nor of its wider use in reference to the
sacraments in the Zurich Agreement. There are other elements, such as the
stress on God’s promises and the sacraments as seals, which are characteristic
of  Bullinger,  but  not  of  Zwingli.  (205.35,  206.12,  14,  38–39,  209.14,
210.20–21, 214.4)

The various differences between the Confession and Zwingli’s presenta-
tion of the sacraments are clear evidence that the Confession is not Zwing-
lian. 46 It is, however, possible that Zwingli could have afﬁrmed it, as it safe-
guarded the major concerns which he expressed. Despite their differences,
Zwingli’s later works and the Confession have a family likeness.

5 Conclusion – Bullinger and Zwingli

One  of  the  clearest  differences  in  sacramental  theology  between  Zwingli
and Bullinger is that in Bullinger it is God who is the subject of the sacra-
ments. This is manifest in each of the confessions, though more obviously in
1549 (articles 7, 8, 12–14) and 1556 (articles 19 and 20) than in the brief ex-
position in article 20 in 1536. It is this which is most striking, along with the
contrast between the essentially positive presentation of the sacraments in
the  confessions  and  the  largely  negative  presentations,  even  in  Zwingli’s
later writings.

There are other differences, most notably the role of election and that of
the Holy Spirit. Election is used by Zwingli in defence of infant baptism, but
not in his exposition of the sacraments nor in particular of their effectiveness.
It is, however, used in all these confessions. In the ﬁrst and third it is used
only in relation to baptism. In the Agreement, however, it is used of the sac-

45 Bühler (p. 231) argues that what Bullinger says about sacramental eating is far from the dis-
putes between Zwingli and Luther. See P. Bühler, Bullinger als Systematiker – am Beispiel der
Confessio Helvetica Posterior, Zwing. 31 (2004) 215–35. In Exposition of the Faith, however,
Zwingli uses the term sacramental eating positively, though not as explicitly as Bullinger. Bul-
linger says that the communicant enjoys the thing itself, whereas Zwingli says, «you eat him
sacramentally .. . when you do inwardly what you perform outwardly, when your heart is re-
freshed by this faith to which you bear witness by the symbols». Zwingli’s concern is to re-
pudiate an eating «naturally or in substance». His emphasis is, therefore, on us and our faith
and only secondarily on our then receiving his forgiveness (Z VI/V 147.3–12, 149.15–150.4,
145.5–7).

raments in general to indicate those in whom the sacraments are effective.
Calvin’s use of it in his correspondence with Bullinger (CO 35.701) probably
accounts for its much larger role in the Agreement in articles 16 and 17.

There is no reference to the role of the Holy Spirit in the sacraments in
1536.  This  is  surprising  given  Bucer’s  part  in  revising  the  Confession.  By
contrast the role of the Spirit is prominent in the Agreement (articles 8, 12,
15, 16, and 23) and also in the Second Helvetic Confession (articles 19–21).
The Holy Spirit has an important role in both Bucer’s and Calvin’s under-
standing of the sacraments, but Bullinger was not necessarily dependent on
them. It is at least as likely that he was inﬂuenced by Augustine. Of course,
the sense that everything is dependent on the Spirit is common to Bullinger
and Zwingli.

One of the more surprising differences between Bullinger and Zwingli is
in the use of the word instrument (instrumentum). Bullinger criticizes the use
of the word and avoids it, even in the Zurich Agreement, where he accepts
the word organum. For him the word instrument implies that the sacraments
have something of their own, apart from God. Zwingli, however, has no dif-
ﬁculty with the word instrument because of his insistence that God is the
cause of all things. He sees people and things as instruments and not causes.
What is attributed to them comes in fact from God not them. Indeed he gives
precisely the example of the sun as an instrument (Z VI/III 112.18–113.5,
165.5–16) which Calvin was later to give in response to Bullinger’s unease
with the term instrument. (CO 35.704) This difference may relate to their
different  understanding  of  God’s  sovereignty.  For  Zwingli  God’s  sover-
eignty  meant  that  God  was  the  cause  of  all  things,  even  of  sin  (Z VI/III
187.8–11).  Bullinger,  by  contrast,  repudiated  a  view  of  God’s  sovereignty
which would make him the author of sin.

The similarities as well as the differences between Zwingli and Bullinger
can  be  seen  in  their  use  of  inward  and  outward  and  comparable  terms.
Zwingli draws from Augustine his strong sense of the sovereignty of God,
who  acts  inwardly  in  drawing  people,  while  we  act  outwardly  with  our
planting and watering, as well as the difference between eating inwardly in
the heart and outwardly with the teeth. Zwingli contrasts the outward and
the inward, emphasising the necessity of what God does inwardly. The stress
on God’s sovereignty and freedom raises the question whether the outward
is really necessary. In his comment on Luke 6:13, Zwingli asks what need
Christ has of apostles, if people do not believe unless God draws them in-
wardly. He answers partly in terms of what God wills and partly in terms of
the way we are made: we are not angels, but have outward senses. (S VI/I
582.18–28) Elsewhere in 1531 he states that what God does in the heart, he
does  through  instruments,  such  as  the  apostles  whom  he  sent  to  preach.
(Z XI 476.25–28)

74

Zwingliana XXXIII, 2006

The Sacraments in the Confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566 – Bullinger’s Understanding

Zwingli accepted the Marburg article on the outward word which says
that the Spirit «effects and creates faith through and with the spoken word».
His belief, however, in the freedom of the Spirit was safeguarded by the fact
that it is the Spirit not the word who effects faith and the statement that he
does so «where and in whom he wills». (Z VI/II 522.12–17) The contrast be-
tween inward and outward is related to Zwingli’s conviction that «God alone
can purify the soul or inward man», otherwise salvation would be at our dis-
posal,  for  we  can  do  outward  things  such  as  baptism.  (Z IV  267.1–9)  He
raised this objection in 1525, when rejecting the view that at the same time as
we  administer  the  sacraments  to  someone,  what  they  signify  happens  in-
wardly. (Z III 761.1–8)

Zwingli’s concern to maintain the sovereignty of God in our salvation led
to great caution in what he said about word and sacrament as well as the min-
istry. To him Roman and Lutheran views of the sacraments put salvation at
our disposal and were, therefore, a return to Judaism. This led him, quite
apart from his neo-platonism, sharply to distinguish the outward and the in-
ward, and to lay the stress on the inward. He could, however, afﬁrm the out-
ward, as long as the freedom of the Spirit was safeguarded, as in the Marburg
articles.

The Augustinian parallel of outward and inward was, of course, used by
other Reformers. Bucer used it from the beginning and in the early 1530s
used it positively, as he did in describing Zwingli’s position in 1536. Bullinger
stood broadly in the same Augustinian tradition. The sense of the Spirit’s
working  inwardly  is  present  in  the  Zurich  Confession  (HBBW  4.423.54,
426.139–143) as is the Zwinglian statement that the Spirit draws, as he wills,
sometimes  without,  sometimes  with  the  instrument.  (HBBW  4.423.54,
426.139–43, 427.175–77) 47 Although the words inward and outward are not
used  in  the  First  Helvetic  Confession,  the  ﬁfteenth  article  expresses  what
underlies them. It features in 1549 and 1566. 48

Two factors, at least, led Bullinger to a more positive relation of the out-
ward and inward than Zwingli: his positive presentation of what the sacra-
ments are and of what God does in them, and the need, both theological and
political, to seek unity with the other Swiss churches as well as with Luther.
The latter led to an accommodation with others, as it had done with Zwingli

47

It also uses analogy to describe the sacraments, which is comparable with the parallel of in-
ward and outward. (425.126–426.130)

48 Gerrish argues (pp. 239–40) for three expressions of eucharistic theology in Reformed Con-
fessions – symbolic memorialism (Zwingli), symbolic parallelism (Bullinger), and symbolic
instrumentalism (Calvin). (In the second and third there is communion with Christ in the
Lord’s Supper.) He holds that in Exposition of Faith Zwingli’s symbolic interpretation «is de-
veloped in the direction of a kind of parallelism». B. A. Gerrish, The Lord’s Supper in the Re-
formed Confessions, in: Theology Today 23 (1966) 224–43.

at and after Marburg. The accommodation could be achieved, as in 1549, by a
careful balance of emphasis. Contact with Calvin, however, perhaps not least
his insistence on God’s truthfulness, enabled Bullinger to stress, more than
he might otherwise have done, the conjunction as well as the distinction be-
tween the outward and the inward.

Interpretation is governed by our perception of others. When a theolo-
gian is perceived as essentially on or not on your side, then he is interpreted
in the light of that. This was true of Bullinger’s perception at different points
of Bucer and Calvin, as it was of their view of Zwingli. Bucer interpreted
Zwingli’s  view  of  the  sacrament  positively  in  1536,  a  year  notable  for  his
closer association with Luther. Bullinger asserted the continuity of Zwingli’s
teaching with his and the Zurich Confession in 1534 (HBBW 4.370.3–371.9)
and with Calvin and the Zurich Agreement in 1554 (CO 43.276–278). Calvin
also, despite his earlier criticism of Zwingli’s views, afﬁrmed that Zwingli
would not have changed the Zurich Agreement. (CO 37.11) That could be
true,  but  it  is  equally  true  that  in  their  different  ways  the  Confessions  of
1536, 1549, and 1566 show important differences between Zwingli and Bul-
linger as well as continuity.

Abstract

The article considers how far Bullinger is Zwinglian in his understanding of
the sacraments by reference to the three Confessions of 1536, 1549, and 1566.
It does this by examining ﬁrst Zwingli’s later writings on the sacraments, to
which Bullinger refers, and then each of the Confessions. The Zurich Agree-
ment is set in context by an analysis of the correspondence between Bullinger
and Calvin. Much of what Zwingli wrote is concerned with what the sacra-
ments are not, whereas the Confessions are more concerned with what they
are. In the Confessions, moreover, God is the subject of the sacraments, and
there is a clear conjunction as well as a distinction between the sign and what
it signiﬁes. The article shows the continuity between Zwingli and Bullinger
as well as the important differences.
