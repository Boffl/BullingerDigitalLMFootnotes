Myths and Reality about Heinrich

Bullinger’s Wife Anna

Rebecca A. Giselbrecht

The truths and myths about Anna Bullinger Adlischwyler are re-
presentative of an enigmatic phenomenon – the missing life stories
of the 16th century women who lived at the epicenter of the Zurich
Reformation. Writing Anna’s life is like projecting the hologram of
a prototype housewife; however, by painting the world around
Anna, the substance of a real woman does emerge, and a recon-
structed narrative appears – a narrative that represents the choices
women made in 16th century Zurich. After considering the sources
available – including Heinrich Bullinger’s correspondence with
Anna,1 his Diarium,2 Eheschriften,3 Anna’s only handwritten let-
ter,4 and my exegesis of some writings about her – I aim to suggest
that the narrative reconstruction of Anna’s life is not only a con-
tribution to social history, but also that a gender-inclusive histo-
rical theology of marriage is incomplete without narratives of pra-
xis.

1. Anna Adlischwyler

Anna was the daughter of Elisabeth Stadler (–1529)5 and Hans
Adlischwyler (–1512) von Rapperswil, a citizen of Zurich since
1491. Hans was the reputable cook of Mayor Waldmann and the
luxury loving guild master Ulrich Trinkler: the Obrigkeitlicher
Weinschek zum Elsässer. Hans Adlischwyler belonged to the social
elite, as he was the manager of the Zunft zum Weggen and Zunft
zur Meisen, two guilds where Zurich politics and power games
played out.6 Typical of the facts in Anna’s sketchy biography, her
birth date remains approximate. The domestic court protocol of 2
July 1528 locates Anna’s birth in 1505, while the Glückshafenro-
del register contains a record of »Anneli Adattschwiler’s« birth in
1504.7

Anna had one half-brother, Johannes Adlischwyler (–1564),
from Hans Adlischwyler’s first marriage. Their father died in Pavia
as a cook for a field captain in 1512, leaving Anna with a sizable
inheritance of three hundred and twenty rheinische Gulden in four
securities, 1785 Pfund of good coins from Zurich in fourteen se-
curities, a house worth one-hundred pounds, some cash and silver
dishes worth seventy pounds, three beds, and other household ef-
fects.8 Anna was not poor.

2. Zurich and Cloister Oetenbach

On 22 July 1522, the council of Zurich ratified the Disputation9
mandating that Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531) preach according
to scripture. The Council also considered it negligence to keep the

truth from the women in the convents of Zurich; thus, in the sum-
mer of 1522, Zwingli preached, Of the Clarity and Certainty of
the Word of God to the nuns in Zurich.10 No original sources
indicate any particular reason why Anna chose to serve in Zurich
as a nun in cloister Oetenbach, however, 19th century historians,
including Carl Pestalozzi, claim that Anna’s mother placed her in
Oetenbach to honor her father after his death in 1512.11 However,
there is also no indication whatsoever that Anna was one of the
nuns who moved into Oetenbach around 1525 after the convents
of Grimmenturm, Selnau, and St. Verena were closed.12 In fact,
even if Anna had chosen to avoid Zwingli’s teachings or she was a
member of the Dominican Reformation resistance movement,
Anna certainly knew of Zwingli’s vigorous apologetic. Nonethe-
less, records indicate that she did not join the Dominican Order
until 1523, well into the Reformation.13 Anna’s circumstances are
most curious considering the documents evidencing that since late
1524 the cloister Oetenbach was an oppositional strong hold whe-
re meetings were held to plot against the reform. In fact, Küngolt
von Breitenlandenberg, the prioress, did not leave Oetenbach until
1525 when she and several other nuns sought asylum in Roman
Luzern.14

Also due to the Zurich reform, Katharina von Zimmern
(1478–1547) the abbess and most powerful woman in Zurich re-
signed her position in 1525, the same year in which an agreement
of rescission was reached concerning Oetenbach, and the convent
building was left to the discretion of the state.15 Bruce Gordon
summarizes the situation with the words, »Zwingli had raised the
status of marriage to one of the most revered aspects of the Chris-
tian faith, but there is no doubt that the Reformation closed off to

women all careers other than the household.«16 In 1875, the his-
torian Raget Christoffel claimed that without question Anna had
listened to Zwingli’s sermon in 1522 and became a champion of
Evangelical truth.17 If Christoffel is correct, then, why was Anna
Adlischswyler still living in Oetenbach in 1527, two years after its
closure?

3. Anna Adlischwyler and Heinrich Bullinger, a well

documented courtship

Heinrich Bullinger II18 (1504–1575) began courting Anna with his
letter of intent on 30 September 1527.19 He wrote in the spirit of
the Zurich moral Reformation in which marriage was essential to
the translation of society into a scripturally founded practical sys-
tem intended to transform the culture of Zurich. Indeed, Bullinger
also had an acute personal and familial interest in the concept of
matrimony. Heinrich Bullinger’s own father Heinrich Bullinger I
(1469–1533) from Bremgarten was ordained as a priest in 1493,
but he had been forced to live in exile from his home in Bremgar-
ten because he lived out of wedlock with the beautiful Anna
Wiederkehr (–1541), whose two brothers threatened to kill Hein-
rich I if they ever got their hands on him. It was not until 1506, a
year after Heinrich I was born, and after Anna Wiederkehr’s brot-
hers became war casualties, that Heinrich Bullinger I and his con-
cubine Anna Wiederkehr returned to Bremgarten where Heinrich
II grew up as the youngest of five brothers born to Heinrich Bul-
linger I, the priest.20

18 People were often named after their parents during the 16th century; thus, the
reformer Heinrich Bullinger referred to here was named after his father, and subse-
quently named his own son Heinrich. In order to avoid confusion, for the duration of
this article, whenever their could be confusion, I will use the names Heinrich Bullinger I,
Heinrich Bullinger II – the reformer – and Heinrich Bullinger III – the reformer’s son.

Heinrich Bullinger II, the reformer, was interested in marriage
from a pragmatic theological point of view but was also a roman-
tic – even authoring a love song for his wedding.21 Already in
February 1525, the twenty-one year-old Bullinger shared his ex-
pert advice on marriage in a reply to a letter from his student Marx
Rosen.22 Bullinger specifically defined masculine marital behavior
in his letter to Rosen, depicting the woman as a mere object and
portraying her to be the weaker vessel, as he pieced together a
picture of the female sex using Bible citations. He also made it
clear to Rosen that a woman was not to be beaten.23

By personally pursuing Anna Adlischwyler, Bullinger created an
interesting legal situation when he ignored the social mores of mar-
riage and its usual third party facilitation. Instead, Bullinger sent
Anna a very lengthy letter asking for her hand. With logical and
forceful arguments for marriage and the Reformed faith, Bullinger
pressed his intentions, trying to convince Anna that life in the con-
vent was neither biblical, nor God’s will for her future. After de-
claring his personal integrity, financial situation, and love for An-
na, Bullinger, who was all of twenty-three years old, wrote: »Yes,
you are young, and God did not give you such a body, and did not
create you so that you remain an eternal madam and do nothing so
that fruit comes from you.« He tells her not to stay a virgin stuck
between the walls of a convent,24 and closes with instructions:
»Read my letter three or four times, think about it, and ask God so
that he tells you what his will is in this matter.«25 Bullinger’s first
letter is remarkably similar to The Complete Teaching on Christian
Marriage,26 a tract that he had begun to write two months pre-
viously on his 23rd birthday, 18 July 1527.

On 29 October 1527, Bullinger wrote in his Diarium27 that he
had met with Anna Adlischwyler in the Grossmunster Church on

27 October 1527 where she had promised him marital faithfulness.
In contrast, the next Diarium entry is: »Her mother was still living
as a widow, aged, and invalid. To her the very mention of our
marriage was extremely detestable. Thence, for a while, we kept it
a secret.«28 Some discrepancy exists concerning the mother-in-law.
Fritz Blanke contends that Elisabeth Adlischwyler (–1529) was li-
ving with her daughter in Oetenbach at the time of Bullinger’s
proposal, but the editors of Bullinger’s correspondence footnote
that Anna’s mother moved into Oetenbach a few weeks before her
death in 1529.29 Notwithstanding, Anna must have communicated
with Bullinger sometime after October 1527 asking him to release
her from their prenuptial agreement. Despite the fact that Anna’s
letter is lost, Bullinger’s next correspondence with Anna refers to
her written renege; albeit, an engagement in 1527 was a legally
binding contract to be spoken in the presence of witnesses. Not so
with Anna and Heinrich; there were no witnesses to their enga-
gement.

Bullinger’s second letter to Anna, written at the end of 1527 or
in the first half of 1528,30 is less melodious, even rather salty.
Bullinger replied like a jilted suitor and applied pressure on Anna
to reassess her position. In his reply, he mentions the letter that
Anna sent telling him that she did not want to leave the convent.
Bullinger, armed with Bible texts, informed Anna that God wants
people to be married. He asked her not to bring ridicule upon him
by refusing to marry him. In addition, Bullinger asserted political
power to achieve his intent. Pestalozzi tells us Bullinger sent Huld-
rych Zwingli (1484–1531)31 to Oetenbach to have a word with the
twenty-two year-old Anna. Then, Prior Peter Simler (1486–1557),
another leader from Zurich, read a letter seeking domestic juris-
diction for the case – at Bullinger’s request.32 Blanke writes that in
June of 1528, Bullinger presented his two witnesses, both Huld-
rych Zwingli and Peter Simler, to the domestic court in order to

defend the legality of his engagement to Anna; he suggests that
Simler read Anna’s letter to the court. This letter from Anna is also
lost.33 The court ruled that the engagement was binding. Even after
the court ruling, Anna lingered behind the walls of the convent for
almost two years, perhaps considering her options, or perhaps
fearing her mother’s reprisal.

On 24 February 1528, Bullinger sent Anna a third letter, actu-
ally more of a tract. Anna supposedly requested his letter of be-
havioral instructions defining the responsibilities and virtues of a
wife, but Anna’s reply, too, has been lost. Bullinger’s didactic letter
can be divided into two sections. The first part concerns women’s
behavior and virtues, including humility, chastity, and silence. The
second section focuses on gender roles in family arrangements. The
letter ends with an exegesis of 1 Corinthians chapter 7, which
highly praises marriage. Bullinger’s emphasis on how men should
behave is unusual considering that his letter was addressed to a
woman.34 It can be argued that Bullinger did not write the material
in this letter specifically for Anna, but actually used lecture mate-
rial from a series of lectures for pastors that he gave that same year
at the Klosterschule in Kappel on Albis.35 Bullinger’s tract places
great emphasis on Psalm 127 and 128, both of which propagate
procreation, and Proverbs 31,10–31 that stresses female virtue and
selflessness.

On 17 August 1529, just six weeks after her mother passed away
on 24 June, Anna Adlischwyler wed Heinrich Bullinger in Birmens-
dorf at the home of Bullinger’s brother, Johannes (1496–1570).
Pastor Peter Simler officiated the ceremony, and the celebration
was held in private at the dinner table. The groom did not want a
big fuss, nor a celebration that would stir up the town of Brem-
garten where he was pastor. Bullinger’s parents, Heinrich Bullinger
I (1469–1533) and Anna Wiederkehr (–1541) were also married

Bullinger’s »Handbook on Marriage«. See Gsell, Hierarchie und Gegenseitigkeit,
95–98.

quite publically that same year on 31 December in Grossmunster,
Zurich.36

There can be no doubt that Anna, who Bullinger nicknamed his
»beloved hausfrau«,37 choose to literally model her life after the
wife of Psalm 127: »children are a gift of the Lord, the fruit of the
womb is a reward … how blessed is the man whose quiver is full of
them.« Anna adopted Bullinger’s Bible exegesis and instructions
and was fruitful like a vine within her house. Little Anneli was
born to the Bullingers in 1530, and Margarethe in 1531.38 Anna
also had the assistance of a maid named Britta Schmid who passed
away after thirty-four years of service on 11 February 1565.39

4. Myths and Anna Bullinger

The folklore surrounding Anna Bullinger begins with the Second
War of Kappel in 1531 and appears in 19th and early 20th century
Bullinger historiography. The rendition of the Bremgarten events
where Bullinger fled to Zurich in 1531 provides an example of
these. The historians – Pestalozzi (1858),40 Christoffel (1875),41
Good (1901)42 and Blanke (1942)43 – interpreted Anna’s life with
romantic formalism. In their histories they reiterate the 16th cen-
tury mythological narrative. The story goes that a mysterious
white woman was seen ghosting around in Bremgarten when
Zwingli conferred with Bullinger on a night shortly before Zwingli
lost his life in the Battle at Kappel on 11 October 1531.44

In the night of 20–21 November 1531, Christoffel and Pestalozzi
say that Bullinger fled Bremgarten together with his father, his
brother Johannes, and pastor Gervasius Schuler (ca. 1495–1563)
to take refuge in Zurich, leaving Anna, Britta, the infant Anneli,
and baby Margarethe behind.45 As the story goes, the Roman in-
surgents plundered Bullinger I’s home, but not so much the house
of Bullinger II; however, thirty soldiers did move in with Anna,
Britta, and the children. Anna was determined to join Bullinger in
Zurich when she ordered her maid to serve the soldiers, before she
headed toward the city gates, children in tow. The guards had
sealed the gates, but with Amazonian vigor, Anna wrestled the
keys from the guards, left the city, and walked twenty miles, car-
rying her girls to join Bullinger in Zurich. Pestalozzi reports: »Bul-
linger rejoiced heart fully to once again embrace Anna in his
arms.«46 The 19th century myths are not included in Büsser’s Bul-
linger biography from 2004.47

5. A fruitful »Hausfrau«

After Bullinger’s installation in Grossmunster on 9 December
1531, the life-writing concerning Anna grows mundane, modeled
especially after Psalm 128 as Bullinger had suggested in his letter of
instruction, »your children like olive plants around your table.«48
Anna bore Heinrich eleven children in eighteen years. She gave
birth to Anneli in 1530, Margarethe in 1531, Elisabeth 1532,
Heinrich 1534, Hans Rudolf in 1536, Christof 1537, Hans in
1539 and Diethelm in 1541, but both died in 1541, Veritas 1543,
Dorothea in 1545, and Felix who was born in 1547, died in
1553.49 Anna continued to be fruitful until she was forty-three

years old. She evidently embraced her role as a Hausfrau and fol-
lowed Bullinger’s instructions to model herself after the virtuous
woman of Proverb 31, who »rises also while it is still night and
gives food to her household and portions to her maidens.«50

The Bullinger’s kitchen table provided for orphans, students,
persecuted reformers, and their families. Already living in the Bul-
linger household by 1536 were at least five of the Bullinger’s own
children, Bullinger’s mother,
the English student Nicholas
Partridge, the maid Britta, Bullinger’s charge Rudolf Gwalther
(1519–1585), and probably Anna Reinhart (1484–1538), Zwing-
li’s widow, and their two daughters Regula (1524–1565) and Anna
born in 1530.51 Bullinger’s correspondence is graced with praise
for Anna’s hospitality, including greetings to Anna from a long list
of men and women. In April 1544, Johannes Gast’s (–1552) wife
Apollonia sent Anna a pair of knives as a gesture of thanks for her
kindness,52 and Pastor Heinrich Lüthi from Winterthur sent his
greetings to Anna along with four roosters.53 Even Calvin was
more than likely a guest at Anna’s table during his 1537 visit with
Bullinger in Zurich. Both the Italian Secondo Curione (1503–1569)
and the German Wolfgang Musculus (1497–1563), along with
their large families, found refuge in Anna’s home for extended
periods. Notwithstanding, the fragments of Bullinger’s bookkeep-
ing going back to 1555, as well as bills and shopping lists from
between 1561–1564, indicate that he controlled the finances, how
much bread the family ate, and made sure that they drank good
wine.54

Bullinger called his family a joy.55 Logically, the daily care and
responsibility for family functionality fell on Anna. She certainly
experienced sorrow at the loss of her babies Hans, Diethelm, and
Felix. While Anna was surly worried about her nephew Hans
Adlischwyler, who was jailed for raping a girl – the news of which

killed his mother in 154456 – Anna was anxious about her own
children. On 20 December 1553, Bullinger wrote to their son:

»Your mother makes big eyes when you already speak of needing another
pair of shoes for the winter. It is hardly fifteen weeks since you left us,
when you took three pairs with you, the red, the gray, and black. At this
rate, you will need six pairs a year. I have more than enough with two. Do
not let your shoes go to pieces, but get them mended on time.«57

Furthermore, along these same lines, the only surviving handwrit-
ten letter by Anna reads:

»My friendly greetings my dear, and know that it makes me completely
happy that you are so well provided for. I ask you to be sound, hard
working, and to clean yourself, fearing God, honorable toward God, and
all people. I ask you to always think about why you are in a foreign place
and to watch the time for doing what needs to be done, not being slothful,
and praying without ceasing, loyally. And protect yourself from bad com-
pany and enjoy staying home. In addition to this, let me know how your
clothing is, and if you have enough shirts or how they are being washed.
They must be soaped or given to the woman again sometimes. It is so hot.
Write it down, and greet her from me. And do not let your shoes fall apart,
give them to be cleaned, and be domestic. May God not only protect you
from suffering. From me. Anna Bullingerin. Your mom.«58

At the end of Anna’s letter, there is an addendum in Bullinger’s
handwriting:

»Greetings from daddy too.«

In 1564, the plague conquered Zurich; Bullinger was deathly ill
when he called the church leaders together on 17 September, bles-
sed them, told them to be longsuffering and loyal, and finally ent-
rusted them with the church. A few days later, he wrote in his
Diarium:

56 Hans Jakob Adlischwyler to Bullinger, HBBW 2, no. 711, 37.
57 Translation from Good, Famous Women, 38. The final sentence of Good’s trans-
lation of this letter was also part of Pestalozzi’s text attributed to Anna, but in reality, it
is text from Anna’s one and only letter melted together with Bullinger’s own. The
phenomenon of opportunistic textual and historical license in recording historical nar-
ratives of 16th century women will be discussed in more detail in my forthcoming
dissertation. Compare Zentralbibliothek Zurich Ms. F 59, 252 and Ms. F 59, 259.

»That night the plague also took my beloved Hausfrau Annen Adlischwy-
lerin. She was ill for nine days, called out faithfully to God, and died
blessed. She was buried around noon the next day, Monday, 25 September,
with wonderful participation of the town’s people, the good and honorable
people of the entire city. She was carried to her grave and buried next to
Mr. Hansen Escheren the city notary and Mr. Dr. Peter Martyr, at the place
where you come into the choir and down the long stairs to the gate that
closes the courtyard.«59

The recovering Bullinger was too ill to attend the funeral of his
Hausfrau who had attended to him for thirty-five years.60 The pest
was relentless, killing his daughters Anna and Margareth as well as
his maid Britta, in addition to many others. On 11 November
1564, he wrote to Ambrosius Blarer (1492–1564): »You know that
the Lord has taken the staff of my old age, my loyal, chosen, and
exquisitely godly wife. But the Lord is righteous and his judgment
is righteous.«61

Anna chose to marry Bullinger and to embody his scriptural
ideal, and the olive plants around her table did grow to be power-
ful trees.62 Rudolf Gwalther, the orphan whom the Bullinger’s
sponsored, married Regula Zwingli and became the pastor of St.
Peter’s Church in Zurich. Huldrych Zwingli II, who married Anna
Bullinger II, became the hospital pastor and a professor of theo-
logy; their children included Rudolf, Ulrich, Verena, Margareth
and Regula. Josias Simler (1530–1576) married Elisabeth Bullinger
and was professor of theology at Zurich. Ludwig Lavater married
Margaretha Bullinger and became deacon at Grossmunster; their
children were Felix, Heinrich, Anna, Katharina, and Regula.
Heinrich Bullinger III married Anna Gwalther, the daughter of
Rudolf Gwalther and Regula Zwingli, and was a preacher at Zol-
likon and St. Peter in Zurich. Dorothea Bullinger looked after her
father until his death in 1575 and married Alexander Stockar in
1578.63 Anna can be compared to a tree that bore much fruit.

6. Myths, truths or reconstructing narratives?

Many 19th century historians enlarged on Anna’s life, her suffering,
and her hospitality; thus, they created an Anna persona or myth.
Christoffel refers to Anna as »an angel of comfort«.64 Pestalozzi is
the originator of a quote from Anna that Christoffel also cites, in
which Anna comforted her sister-in-law, but I have not found any
original traces of it in the archives.65 In addition, Pestalozzi also,
however, seems to have confused the letters from Anna Ad-
lischwyler Bullinger and her daughter Anna Bullinger Zwingli.66

Yet, it is no wonder that Christoffel featured Anna as a social
model and moral construct in his 1875 history of Anna and
Heinrich Bullinger, and that the Neujahrsblatt der Zürcherischen
Hülfsgesellschaft of 1860 was dedicated in its entirety to Frau
Mutter and »The Mother of Zurich«, with a silverpoint portrait of
Anna wearing a dress fashioned in 1860, three-hundred years after
her death. This publication is definitely an example of hagiography
that glorifies Anna, propaganda to the youth of Zurich, and useful
for constructing gender roles.67

Disconcerting, however, are the words in the Zürcher Taschen-
buch of 1930 that dismiss Anna: »Heinrich Bullinger wrote not-
hing about his wife, except that she died.«68 More disturbing is
that so little historiography includes analysis of the choices that
Anna and other 16th century women made when they invested
themselves in the Reformation and the people at their kitchen ta-
bles.

Abstract: An attempt to reconstruct Anna Adlischwyler Bullinger’s 16th century bio-
graphy, leaning heavily on contextual history, while taking Heinrich Bullinger’s corre-
spondence, Diarium, Eheschriften, and Anna’s only handwritten letter into considera-
tion. Identifying and including the elements of myth and hagiography that fill Anna’s

biographies from other centuries, although little can be traced to original sources, en-
ables a lively narrative about Anna Bullinger’s life with a window into the lives of
women in Reformation Zurich and a view of how historians perceived them.
