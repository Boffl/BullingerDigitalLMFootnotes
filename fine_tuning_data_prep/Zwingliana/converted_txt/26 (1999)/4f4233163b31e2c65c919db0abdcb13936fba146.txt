Edition of Huldrych Zwingli's 

«Von göttlicher und menschlicher Gerechtigkeit» 

byjEssE  D.  M A NN 

In the printed Version of his 1523 sermon on Divine and Human Righteous-
ness, the Swiss reformer Ulrich Zwingli stated: 

«That someone should have to pay interest on land, a field  or a vineyard 
which you lawyers call a purchase of fruit or custom [ususfructus], whether, 
God willing, there be fruit or no, is a bit too much. I am totally taken aback 
by the fact that those who attended the Council of Constance or Basel were 
so utterly unreasonable even by the Standards of human righteousness in 
allowing  such an unworthy thing to  get by that it was indeed too much 
even  for  unbelieving princes to  allow this among their people. Why did 
they not look to the word of Christ, <you ought to lend and not expect any-
thing in return>?»' 

According to the corresponding note in the Corpus Reformatorum edition of 
this  work, Zwingli's reference here  to  the  Councils of  Constance and Basel 
apparently  encompasses several conciliar sessions and decrees, most notably 
those  dealing with the annates issue.2 However, the case which Zwingli de-

cils sought to abolish;3 nor does it seem to pertain to any of the other possibil-
ities  offered  by  the  Corpus  Reformatorum  editors. More  accurate  is the  re-
nowned  economic historian R. H. Tawney's interpretation  of this passage as a 
denunciation  of  the  Councils  «for  showing  indulgence  to  the  mortgaging  of 
land on the security of crops.»4 Still, what I believe the reformer  may  actually 
have  had  in  mind  was  the  two  Councils'  apparent  approval  of  a  widespread 
credit and investment practice known  as census or redditus  annuus. 

The census was a type of contract  of sale (contractus emptionis  et  venditio-
nis) in which the object  sold was, as the Jesuit Leonhard  Lessius  (1554-1623) 
concisely put  it, «the right of  receiving an annual pension  from  the  property 
[e.g., land,  field  or  vineyard]  or  person  of  another.»5 That  is, in  return  for  a

tant  that  the  English  translators  of  Zwingli's  tract  repeat  the  references  to  sessions  XL  and 
XLIII of the Council of Constance and Session XXI of the Council of Basel, since they claim

single lump sum, the census purchaser was entitled to receive annual payments 
from the seller for a period specified  by the terms of the census contract. Thus, 
in such contracts, the seller was the debitor  (since he bound  himself  to  make 
the annual payments), while the buyer was the creditor (since he provided  the 
initial sum of  money).6 By the  13th Century, the census was a common way  to 
obtain ready cash, and it soon became a regulär instrument  of State or munic-
ipal credit. In the 15th Century, for example, Phillip the Good of Burgundy used 
the sale of such census as a steady source of income.7 From at least the time of 
Henry of Ghent (d. 1293), however, census contracts had been attacked on the 
ground  that they were really loans at interest  and thus  usurious. 

By  the  early  1400s, the  census, particularly  the  redeemable  census which 
allowed  one party  (usually  the  seller) to  redeem  or  buy  back the census, had 
become so widespread and, at the same time, so morally troubling that the two 
major reform Councils of the fifteenth  Century, Constance and Basel, were both 
asked to address this issue. At Constance, a fourteen-member  committee dis-
cussed  and  apparently  approved  the redeemable  census, although  the  Council 
never  issued  a formal  decree  on  the  matter.8  Following  the  council's  lead,  in 
1425 Pope Martin V officially  endorsed the redeemable census in his bull  Regi-
mini,  which entered into the Corpus iuris canonici.'' But, despite Martin's bull, 
the issue came up again at Basel at least twice, first in 1433 and again in  1441.10

While we know that at least one important  Council father, the Spanish theolo-
gian Juan de Segovia, objected to the redeemable census, it seems probable that 
Basel, like Constance, also endorsed both types of census.  But, again like Con(cid:173)
stance, Basel never issued a formal  decrees on the census, and, so far as I know, 
there is no evidence to indicate an official  conciliar  stance on this  question. 

For  the Councils of Constance  and Basel the problematic  census contract 
was the redeemable census, which looked to many contemporaries like a thin-
ly  disguised  loan  at interest.  For Zwingli,  however,  the troubling  point was 
apparently the seller's Obligation to make an annual payment to the buyer on 
property  which  bore no fruit.  Census  contracts  including  such  an Obligation 
were certainly not unknown," but neither Constance nor Basel seems to have 
been  especially  concerned  about  that  specific  point.  Interestingly,  Zwingli's 
objection seems to reflect a long-standing mistrust of any commercial or finan-
cial transaction in which an investor or lender's potential gain involved neither 
risk nor uncertainty.12 For example, in the 13* Century, the renowned  canonist 
William of Rennes objected  to census contracts «because the buyer took  none 
of  the risks  of  a barren  soil  or of bad weather.»13 That  Zwingli's  indictment 
focuses  on a point  which  apparently  neither  Constance  nor Basel  discussed 
directly  need not imply  that  the reformer  had some other  allegedly  usurious 
practice in mind when  criticizing those Councils. Much  depends on how, and 
how  much,  Zwingli  knew  about  the proceedings  of  these  synods  -  a point 
which  seems  to  require  further  investigation.14  It  is possible  that  Zwingli's 
denunciation of Constance and Basel referred  to their general approval of cen(cid:173)
sus contracts without  intending any reference to this specific  point. 

11  Noonan  159, discusses the census with  a fixed  annual  charge in contrast to the census where 

the return varied with the yield of the census base.

commerce, see Noonan  159; McLaughlin 95ff.; R. Roehl,  Patterns and Structure of Demand,

14  Understandably,  Zwingli's  attitude  toward  the  authority  of  Councils  seems  so far  to  have 
attracted more attention than his knowledge of conciliar history. See, e.g., Fritz  Schmidt-Clau-
sing, Zwingiis  Stellung  zum Konzil, in: Zwa 11, 1962, 479-98; and Fritz  Büsser, Ein unge(cid:173)

Leiden  1985 (SMRT 31), 36-37. Importantly,  as Ramp  63, n. 81 has noted, Zwingli  studied 
the works  of  Gabriel  Biel and Conrad  Summenhart  -  both  of whom  wrote  on census con(cid:173)
tracts -  as part  of his investigation  of the tithe question. A careful  examination  of their  eco(cid:173)
nomic writings, especially Summenhart's massive De contractibus  Ileitis, atque  illicitis, traeta-
tus, might reveal that the reformer  learned  about the Councils' treatment  of the census  from 
one or both of these influential  authors.

Unfortunately, Zwingli's own terminology does not really resolve this mat(cid:173)

ter. In the original German text, the reformer  calls the practice he condemns a 
«früchtkouff»  or «bruch».15 The Corpus Reformatorum  editors annotate only 
the  second  term,  suggesting  that  «bruch»  is  equivalent  to  ususfructus  -  an 
important  concept  in  Roman  law.16  In  the  legal  language  of  Zwingli's  time, 
«bruch»  actually had several meanings.17 Most pertinently in the present  con-
text,  «bruch»  could  mean  «abgäbe»  (= «duty»  or  «fees»), which  is  suggestive 
but still rather general. There seems no compelling reason to associate «bruch» 
exclusively with  annates. «Früchtkouff»,  on the other  hand, appears to be an 
almost  literal  translation  of  the  term  venditio  fructus  employed  by  medieval 
canonists.18 As Terence McLaughlin  has noted, for  the canonists  the  venditio 
fructus,  and  thus perhaps  the  «früchtkouff»  as well, was identical  to  the  rent 
charge or census contract.19 If Zwingli's «früchtkouff»  was indeed  synonymous 
with the lawyers' venditio  fructus,  then the reformer  certainly could have been 
discussing the census question. 

The  subsequent  Latin  version  of  his  sermon  (apparently  translated  and 
edited  by  Zwingli's  son-in-law,  Rudolf  Gwalther)  sheds  little  light  here.20  In 
the Latin text, «früchtkouff»  and «bruch» are rendered simply as ususfructus.™ 
However, the larger issue under consideration  in this section of the sermon is 
translated at least twice as redditus annuus,22 which was of course another name 
for the census. 

Additional information  on these two words will perhaps become available when the relevant 
volumes  of  the  Frühneuhochdeutsches  Wörterbuch,  ed.  by  Robert  R.  Anderson,  Ulrich 
Goebel  and Oskar Reichmann,  Berlin  1986ff., are published.

in 1829 (not mentioned by Georg Finsler, Zwingli-Bibliographie. Verzeichnis der  gedruckten

identically  to  those first  published  by  Gwalther  1544/45; in  contrast  to this, the  more  com-
monly consulted vol. 1, published in 1828, contains twelve German works (partially  different 
from  the Latin works!) (I am grateful to Dr. Heinzpeter Stucki for information  regarding this 
edition.) The recent modern German translation of Zwingli's sermon likewise sheds little addi(cid:173)
tional  light  here. The translator,  Ernst  Saxer, renders  «früchtkouff»  and  «bruch»  as  «Früch(cid:173)

passage in question; see Huldrych Zwingli, Schriften,  Bd.  1, ed. by Thomas  Brunnschweiler,

The evidence presented  here, while admittedly  inconclusive, points  to  the 
real possibility, if not plausibility, that in criticizing the Councils of  Constance 
and Basel, Zwingli was actually referring not to the annates or related matters, 
but to the failure  of these Councils to prohibit  census contracts. That he might 
have done so certainly comes as no surprise. After all, the census question, par-
ticularly the licitness of the census, was still the cause of much uncertainty  and 
debate  in  the  16* Century,  and  the  Protestant  reformers  (especially  Luther) 
were known for  their Opposition to this practice.23 

What, then, of the note in the Corpus  Reformatorum  edition of  Zwingli's 
sermon? At the least, that note should be expanded to include some  reference 
to  the  census debates  at  Constance  and  Basel. At  the  most,  such  a  reference 
should completely replace the current note which is, in fact, too broad and, to 
some degree, misleading. Ultimately, of course, the effect  of such an  emenda-
tion would be to underscore the contribution of the 15th Century reform Coun(cid:173)
cils to  the  discussion  of  the  census question  -  a discussion  which  continued 
well into the  17* Century.
