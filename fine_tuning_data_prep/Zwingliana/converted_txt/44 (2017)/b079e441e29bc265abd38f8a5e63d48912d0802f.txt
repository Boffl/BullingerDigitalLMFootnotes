“Summum Bonum”

in the Zurich Reformation

Zwingli and Bullinger

Aurelio A. Garcı´a

1. The Western Tradition

It was Cicero who originated the use of the term summum bonum
in Latin, to translate the Greek idea of the good.1 For Plato, the
ultimate goal of knowledge is the supreme good, which attracts by
eros the philosopher; it can only be reached by contemplation.
Aristotle, as would be expected, sees it as the target of human
activity.2

In the general Western Christian tradition, we should seek the
origins of the use of the term summum bonum as a description of
God in Augustine of Hippo. In particular his work De bono, which
is a refutation of Manichaeism, uses the term centrally, as it con-
stitutes a Neoplatonist-based refutation of the dualistic doctrine.

1 Used for example in De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum 1.26.
2 Aristotle tends to deconstruct Plato’s notion of the highest good. He states in the
Nicomachean Ethics (I.7): “Happiness, therefore, being found to be something final and
self-sufficient, is the End at which all actions aim. To say however that the Supreme
Good is happiness will probably appear a truism; we still require a more explicit ac-
count of what constitutes happiness.” What is translated here as the Supreme Good is
simply τοÁ αÍ ριστον. Elsewhere in arguing against Plato’s notion of an essence beyond
the thing itself, he closely associates unity and goodness as substances which have no
other substances or entities prior to them (cf. Metaphysics book 7, chapter 1).

“Summum Bonum” in the Zurich Reformation

Augustine begins the short work basing his deductive discussion on
the description of God as summum bonum. He states:

“The highest good, than which there is no higher, is God, and consequently
He is unchangeable good, hence truly eternal and truly immortal. All other
good things are only from Him, not of Him. For what is of Him, is Himself.
And consequently if He alone is unchangeable, all things that He has made,
because He has made them out of nothing, are changeable. For He is so
omnipotent, that even out of nothing, that is out of what is absolutely non-
existent, He is able to make good things both great and small, both celestial
and terrestrial, both spiritual and corporeal.”3

It is clear from the nature and purpose of the discussion that Au-
gustine will concentrate on the ontological aspects of God: he will
use the definition of God as supreme good as the basis of deriva-
tion of all things, as from the One, the source, in a Neo-Platonist
fashion. But this does not mean a soteriological horizon is totally
absent. God as source of all good is not responsible for evil, which
comes out of free volition. Creation is good; the abuse of a crea-
ture is evil. God is capable of turning evil into good. The rest of the
discussion leads into the refutation of Manichean errors in this
brief treatise. However, the establishment of summum bonum as
point of departure for the discussion certainly gave great promi-
nence to the term.

3 The whole text runs: “Summum bonum, quo superius non est, Deus est; ac per
hoc incommutabile bonum est, ideo vere aeternum et vere immortale. Caetera omnia
bona non nisi ab illo sunt sed non de illo. De illo enim quod est, hoc quod ipse est; ab
illo autem quae facta sunt, non sunt quod ipse. Ac per hoc, si solus ipse incommutabilis,
omnia quae fecit, quia ex nihilo fecit, mutabilia sunt. Tam enim omnipotens est ut possit
etiam de nihilo, id est ex eo quod omnino non est, bona facere, et magna et parva, et
caelestia et terrena, et spiritalia et corporalia. Quia vero et iustus est, ei quod de se
genuit, ea quae de nihilo fecit non aequavit. Quia ergo bona omnia, sive magna, sive
parva, per quoslibet rerum gradus, non possunt esse nisi a Deo, omnis autem natura in
quantum natura est, bonum est; omnis natura non potest esse nisi a summo et vero Deo:
quia omnia etiam non summa bona, sed propinqua summo bono, et rursus omnia etiam
novissima bona, quae longe sunt a summo bono, non possunt esse nisi ab ipso summo
bono. Omnis ergo spiritus etiam mutabilis et omne corpus a Deo: et haec est omnis
facta natura. Omnis quippe natura aut spiritus, aut corpus est. Spiritus incommutabilis
Deus est. Spiritus mutabilis facta natura est sed corpore melior. Corpus autem spiritus
non est, nisi cum ventus, quia nobis invisibilis est et tamen vis eius non parva sentitur,
alio quodam modo spiritus dicitur.” Augustine, De natura boni contra Manichaeos

In his Etymologies, Isidore of Seville has a long list of the divine
names, much of which is impacted by Platonist philosophy, but he
fails to list summum bonum. However, Isidore does have a book,
De summo bono, in which he discusses doctrine in general, having
the supreme good as point of departure.4 Nonetheless, his brief
discussion of the highest good runs along Augustine’s lines and
concerns, and ultimately fails to develop the theme as such, that is,
how and why is God the supreme good. Neither is there, as far as I
can see, a relating of the term summum bonum to the revelation of
the divine name as “I am,” in Isidore.

One of the most distinguished moments of this doctrine of Neo-
platonist provenance occurs in Anselm of Canterbury. In his Pos-
logion Anselm turns the intellectual quest for the summum bonum
into an ontological proof of God’s existence: “God is whatever it is
better to be than not to be; and he, as the only self-existent being,
creates all things from nothing”:

“What are you, then, Lord God, than whom nothing greater can be con-
ceived? But what are you, except that which, as the highest of all beings,
alone exists through itself, and creates all other things from nothing? For,
whatever is not this is less than a thing which can be conceived of. But this
cannot be conceived of you. What good, therefore, does the supreme Good
lack, through which every good is? Therefore, you are just, truthful, bles-
sed, and whatever it is better to be than not to be. For it is better to be just
than not just; better to be blessed than not blessed.”5

In the text book of theology for the Middle Ages, Petrus Lombar-
dus’ Book of Sentences, we find the term summum bonum used in
reference to the Trinity, and as the goal of human desire, with a
direct allusion to Augustine’s writings.6

“Summum Bonum” in the Zurich Reformation

The books of the most revered medieval theologian, Thomas
Aquinas, are loaded with passages using the term. Since the scale
of being is one of his leitmotifs, it is easy to understand the fre-
quency of use. However, this use of the concept as presupposition
of the system does not entail that a lot of clarity is shed on it. As it
would be in Plato, the highest good is the goal of our quest. The
summum bonum is seen as the source of all, or as the goal of all.
Aquinas will state that: 1. by natural dilection it happens that
anyone loves God above all things, when He is known to be the
supreme good, and thus liable of being loved in Himself. But we
enjoy what we love for its own sake;7 2. The Highest Good cannot
be the cause of any evil;8 3. Whatever is the Highest Good is pre-
eminently then the goal of all things. But the Highest Good is one
inasmuch as He is God. Therefore all things are ordered as to their
end towards the one good which is God.9 Taking the overarching
view of the tradition up to Aquinas, we can conclude that while
already in Plato the form of the Good is the goal of striving by all
subjects of knowledge because to seek to know is to have eros
towards the Form of the Good, nevertheless this early theology is
paradigmatically ontic (dealing in categories of being). Yet it does
indeed have pressing ethical and epistemological consequences.
However, once we move into the Christian context after Augus-
tine, the striving is not merely gnoseological but has a more clearly
soteriological side to it.

2. Summum Bonum in Zwingli

The issue of the importance and use of the term summum bonum
in Zwingli rises to prominence particularly because of its use in the
Sermon on Providence.10 Here critics have long detected a parti-
cular way of doing theology, which seems to have as point of
departure a philosophical argument rather than taking off imme-
diately from the Biblical texts; this looked like a methodological
infraction, a paganizing resource to plain reason. It thus caught the
polemical attention of the Lutheran party in his time. It thus left a
tinge of doubt that lasts to this day.11 A closer inspection will show
that Zwingli’s argument runs in such a manner that it will come to
rest mainly on Biblical texts and arguments at the climax of his
demonstration; nevertheless, it is evident that his particular me-
thodology here requires explanation.12 It is obvious that he is well
within the bounds of theological precedent, especially in view that
philosophy in the Middle Ages was seen as a discipline both pro-
paedeutic and ancillary to theology, and used so without embar-
rassment. It would be the newer standards of protestant Biblicism
that would require a strictly scriptural argument, a condition to

10 Huldreich Zwinglis sämtliche Werke [Z], vol. 6.3, Zurich 1983 (Corpus Refor-

matorum 93.3), 1–230.

11 Se for example Leonhard von Muralt, Zwinglis dogmatisches Sondergut (Schluss),
in: Zwingliana 5/7 (1932), 353–368, here 357–358: “Diese starke Einschränkung, die
sich die Vernunft hier noch gefallen lassen muß, wenn auch prinzipiell durch den Ge-
danken der pädagogischen Stufenfolge ihr Wert gesichert ist, tritt nun in der Schrift ‘De
providentia dei’ wesentlich zurück. Hier ist die Erkenntnis des Wesens Gottes (quid deus
sit) nicht auf die biblische Offenbarung beschränkt. Biblische und außerbiblische Got-
teserkenntnis stehen einander gleichwertig Seite an Seite.”

12 The particularity of his thought in this regard is underlined even in sympathizing
critics. In his description of Zwingli’s doctrine of God as being and as good being,
Martin Sallmann states: “Dieses Sein ist zudem auch das Gute. Zwingli nennt dafür drei
Belege aus der Schrift. Von der guten Schöpfung Gottes, die dieser selbst als sehr gut
betrachtet (Gen 1,31), schließt er zurück auf den guten Urheber. Zusammen mit der
Stelle: ‘Niemand ist gut außer Gott allein’ (Lk 18,18), kommt es zu einer Wendung mit
‘pantheistischem’ Anklang, die Zwingli aber sofort einschrankt: ‘Wenn nämlich alle
Dinge, die sind, gut sind, und dennoch allein Gott gut ist, ergibt sich, daß alle Dinge, die
sind, Gott sind, das heißt, daher sind, weil Gott ist, und er die essentia von diesen ist.’
Das wird durch die dritte, bei Zwingli oft zitierte Stelle untermauert: ‘Da ja aus ihm und
durch ihn und in ihm alle Dinge sind’ (Rom 11,36).” Martin Sallmann, Zwischen Gott
und Mensch: Huldrych Zwinglis theologischer Denkweg im De vera et falsa religione

“Summum Bonum” in the Zurich Reformation

which Zwingli usually is obliging. However, it is not necessary
now to dwell on all possible reasons for this departure from the
standard protestant model; rather it is necessary to point out the
particular use and benefit that justifies Zwingli’s approach in this
text.13

Zwingli wishes to demonstrate the reality of divine providence in
order to move on to the soteriology, in which God out of sheer
goodness and grace delivers the human being from his sin. Ulti-
mately, as the argument runs, without being responsible for sin,
God indeed foresaw and allowed the fall to happen, as the neces-
sity of the unstable union of the material and the spiritual in the
human being necessarily would lead to his breaking of the law, the
explicit will of God, in order for him to obtain true knowledge of
good and evil. It is in the need to undergird the fact of divine
providence that the concept summum bonum comes in. It is out of
the very nature of God as the origin and maximum expression of
goodness that Zwingli derives a provident care for creatures. Thus
the concept summum bonum undergirds all theodicy in the Sermon
on Providence. It must be added that the concept had been pre-
viously used by the Zurich reformer, but not in such a central role
as in the Sermon on Providence.

The reformer’s argument begins with a direct statement begin-
ning chapter one: “Providence must exist, because the supreme
good necessarily cares and regulates all things.” Zwingli proceeds
in clearly neo-platonic fashion defining the essence of the concept.
The supreme good is so called not merely because it is a good
surpassing all other real goods in quantity or quality, but because
it is “the only thing good by nature.” In fact we find reminiscences
of Anselm’s argument: every good that can be conceived is itself
really this supreme good. In referring to God, Zwingli now sup-
ports now his argument with a Biblical quote by Christ: “Why do
you call me good? There is none good but God.” Thus, Summum
bonum means ultimately that God alone deserves the name good:

13 Among the reasons one can conceive, is that the Sermon on Providence was a
showpiece of Humanism, produced to demonstrate dialectical facility. It also might
represent an effort to respond to a contemporary strain of thought that defended a
notion of Stoic fate. It also principally addresses a question of theodicy, which if treated
strictly on the basis of Biblical argument, ran the risk of being circular.

we see that God alone is good in the sense of being an absolutely
and perfectly good being, and that consequently there can be not-
hing good which is not He. Other things can be called good only
because the share in divine goodness, that is to say, by derivation.14
Zwingli continues arguing that what is good in the supreme
degree must also be true, an argument most acceptable, as it de-
rives from the root of the Platonic tradition. From here he derives
that if the Supreme Divinity is the supreme good, and truth belongs
to the nature of the good, the supremely true is also supreme might
and power.15 With the understanding of faith we put together these
philosophical conclusions and ultimately must see “both that Pro-
vidence must exist and that it cares for and regulates all things.”
In other, previous text, where the term does not carry the burden
of sustaining the whole argument, Zwingli reveals other aspects of
his understanding of the concept. In Adversus Hieronymum Em-
serum antibolon, of 1524, he defines summum bonum as omni-
sufficiency for all creatures, relating it to the Hebrew concept: “See
that I am the only God and there is none other besides me. To be
the summum bonum is nothing else than dai: to be the all-suffi-
ciency of all good things.”16 To be the summum bonum also im-

14 So comments von Muralt: “Da nämlich alles, was ist, gut ist, und dennoch Gott
allein gut ist, folgt, daß alles, was ist, Gott ist (ut omnia, quae sunt, deus sint), d.h.
deshalb ist, weil Gott ist und er das Wesen von allem ist (hoc est: ideo sint, quod deus
est, et ipsorum essentia est). Damit will Zwingli doch nicht sagen, daß die Dinge gleich
Gott sind, selber Gott sind, denn dann würden sie ihr Sein und ihre Güte aus sich selber
haben. Er will eben sagen: Sofern überhaupt etwas ist, so kann es nur auf Grund von
Gottes Sein auch Sein haben, und sofern etwas gut ist, so kann es nur auf Grund von
Gott, der das höchste Gut ist, gut sein. Deshalb muß sich ja eben Gott von den Dingen
unterscheiden weil er allein Güte und Sein hat, und die Dinge ihr Sein und ihre Güte erst
von Gott haben. Ich habe bei diesen Stellen immer wieder den tiefen Eindruck, daß
Zwingli nicht einfacher und nicht eindringlicher hätte sagen können, daß Gott der Herr
der Welt ist, daß Gott allein Wirklichkeit und Wesen ist. Vom höchsten Gute aus ge-
langt.” Muralt, Zwinglis dogmatisches Sondergut, 363.

15 It seems Zwingli aims to establish three things: that God exists (by Anselmian
ontological argument); that God is provident, i.e. cares for all inferior entities, somet-
hing he seems to derive from God’s goodness; and that he is powerful and willing to
carry out this providential care. There is an important change here in that in the Pla-
tonic tradition the Supreme Good is the passive attraction for erotical creatures, while
in the Biblical sense God is active love.

16 “Videte, quod ego sim solus, et non sit alius deus pre˛ter me. ‘Deum autem esse’
non est aliud quam: summum bonum esse. Summum bonum esse, non est aliud quam
dai [iDÅ], hoc est: sufficientiam omnis boni esse. Bonum ergo illud se esse, deus nobis

“Summum Bonum” in the Zurich Reformation

plies being the highest wisdom and prudence, as he states in De
vera et falsa religione commentarius of 1525.17 Here he also defi-
nes it as being perfect, absolute and lacking in nothing.18 In this
text something else of great importance occurs. After defining
summum bonum in the very same terms he later would use in De
Providentia, Zwingli draws the inference that the summum bonum
as omnisufficientia of all things implies the God is our God.19 In
doing so, he moves from a necessary, ontological relation, to a
volitional or covenantal one.

In De vera et falsa religione Zwingli uses summum bonum in the
context of God’s self-revelation in the disclosure of the divine na-
me: I am who I am. For Zwingli, God reveals himself wholly in this
expression. It means: I am by myself, by my own power, for my-
self. When he tells Moses to say to the people: “I am” sent me, it
indicates He is the being of all things; ultimately He is the only
being. All other things have a contingent and dependent being, and
God sustains and governs all things. Therefore inasmuch as God is,
he is good.20 Inasmuch as he is truly and of himself, He alone is
good, true, upright, just, holy; inasmuch as He is good, He is true,
upright, etc.21 Inasmuch as all existing things are good, and none-
theless there is no good but God himself, it results that all things

17 “Nam istud, quod deus est, summum bonum non esset, ni simul summa sapientia
et prudentia esset. Si enim quicquam esset, quod deum latere posset, illic nimirum
sapientia [...].” Z 3, 647.

18 “[...] Et contra: Hoc solum deus est, quod perfectum est, id est: absolutum et cui
nihil desit, cuique omnia adsint, quae summum bonum deceant. Non enim de perfecto
hic loquimur, ut vulgo theologi.” Z 3, 647.

19 Von Muralt envisions the connection in a somewhat different manner: “Zwingli
läßt uns doch klar verstehen, wie er Philosophie und Religion zusammenwirken läßt.
Die philosophische Gotteserkenntnis ist da, um dem Menschen mit allen Mitteln des
Denkens die Größe und Allwirksamkeit Gottes einzuprägen und vor Augen zu stellen.
Sinn hat allerdings diese Gotteserkenntnis erst, wenn sie die Menschen so ergreift, daß
sie allein auf Gott vertrauen, wenn ein persönliches Verhältnis daraus wird, das den
Menschen verpflichtet. So ist für Zwingli seine philosophische Gotteserkenntnis nicht
ein gelehrter Hemmschuh, sondern eine mächtige Stütze geworden, indem er in seinem
Denken die Notwendigkeit und Wirklichkeit Gottes anerkannt und dann diese für sein
Leben fruchtbar gemacht hat.” Muralt, Zwinglis dogmatisches Sondergut, 364. In spite
of the less specific description, the connection between the being of God as summum
bonum and his beneficent impact on the human being’s life is clearly detected.

20 “Illud ergo esse tam est bonum, quam est esse.” Z 3, 645.
21 “Sicut enim solum est, et seipso est, ita et solum bonum, verum, rectum, iustum,

sanctum est; nam seipso bonum est, verum, rectum etc.” Z 3, 645.

are God, that is they are in Him and through Him.22 Now Zwingli
supports his arguments with a Pauline quote: for from him and
through him and in him are all things. (Rom. 11:36). The seeming
pantheism this radical theo-centrism implies has been criticized
both in Zwingli and in one of his possible sources, Pico della Mi-
randola.23 However, in both authors it is a standard Neo-Platonist
conception. Besides, it is clear from the context Zwingli does not
intend the non-orthodox meaning. The main importance is the
relating of the term summum bonum not only to the very essence
of God, but particularly to God’s self-revelation in the disclosure
of the divine name, for it implies an approach to humanity, a
preliminary covenanting relationship to the people.

Finally, in Subsidium sive coronis de eucharistia, also of 1525,
summum bonum again immediately implies redemption. “And this
one, who you worship and adore thus, is so your God, that is to
say, summum bonum, who freely gives himself over to you, that he
would lower Himself on your behalf in order to reconcile you.”24
This definition comes in the midst of a discussion of the foedus or
covenant, therefore in a completely soteriological context. We may
conclude, then, that in Zwingli the purely philosophical use of

22 “Si nunc omnia, quae fecit, vehementer bona sunt etiam se iudice, et nihilominus
nemo bonus est nisi solus deus, sequitur, quod omnia, quae sunt, in ipso et per ipsum
sunt. Cum enim omnia, quae sunt, bona sunt, et tamen solus deus bonus est, fit, ut
omnia, quae sunt, deus sint, hoc est: ideo sint, quod deus est, et ipsorum essentia est.
Quod Paulus sic extulit Ro. 11. [Rom 11:36]: ‘Quoniam ex ipso et per ipsum et in ipso
sunt omnia’.” Z 3, 645.

23 The issue of Zwinglis potential dependence on Pico della Mirandola is explored
by Irena Backus, among others (Irena Backus, Randbemerkungen Zwinglis in den Wer-
ken von Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, in: Zwingliana 18/4–5 [1990/91], 291–309). It
is also worthwhile to mention that in one of Pico’s works read by Zwingli, the relati-
onship between being and goodness in God is discussed. Pico states in De ente et uno:
“Adiiciam et hoc iniuria gloriari quosdam Platonicos quasi mysterium habeant Aris-
toteli ignotum, cum dicunt duas esse proprias Dei appellationes, unum scilicet et bo-
num, atque ita bonum et unum ante ens esse. Sicut enim ostendimus non latere Peri-
pateticos quo modo supra ens Deus intelligi possit, possumus et hoc ostendere duo in
primis haec nomina, boni scilicet et unius, Deo Aristotelem dedisse.” (Giovanni Pico
della Mirandola, De hominis dignitate Heptalus De ente et uno, ed. Eugenio Garin,
Florence 1942, 404). Pico also makes note of the revelation to Moses of the divine name
in relation to the essential qualities of God.

24 “At ille, quem sic colis et adoras, sic est deus tuus, hoc est: summum bonum, quod
se tibi gratuito impertit, ut pro te in mortem sese abiecerit, quo te sibi reconciliaret.” Z
4, 500.

“Summum Bonum” in the Zurich Reformation

summum bonum in argument, is to the effect of undergirding di-
vine providence, which is then used to support a soteriological
theodicy. This occurs in the special case of De providentia. Else-
where and previously, we may conclude that Zwingli ties summum
bonum closely to the divine name, and thus to self-revelation. It
ultimately stands as the basis for the divine part in the covenant,
although not in a totally explicit fashion. The soteriological inten-
tion has substantially displaced the ontological use and now per-
vades and ultimately predominates in the use of the concept.

3. Summum Bonum in Bullinger

The term summum bonum is only cited once in the Confessio Hel-
vetica Posterior at chapter three, the first paragraph.25 It is used as
part of a formal, philosophical definition of God, thus showing
one of the term’s main functions in Bullinger’s theology.

In the apologetic work, Confessio et expositio simplex ortho-
doxae fidei et dogmatum Catholicorum sincerae religionis Chris-
tianae, God is defined using summum bonum among other terms:
“We believe and teach that God is one in essence or nature, sub-
sisting of Himself, sufficient by Himself in all things, invisible,
incorporeal, immense, eternal, creator of all things, both visible
and invisible, highest good, living and giving life and conserving all
things, omnipotent, knowing to the greatest degree, clement or
merciful, just and truthful.” This is the same definition he used in
The Old Faith.

In the Decades, we find a similar connection between the biblical
texts and the philosophical concept, once again, in the description
of the divine names. Peter Opitz in his discussion of Bullinger’s
theology in the Decades, stresses how the divine essence is ex-
pressed through the names. Particularly in relationship to El Shad-

25 “Deum credimus et docemus unum esse essentia vel natura, per se subsistentem,
sibi ad omnia sufficientem invisibilem, incorporeum, immensum, aeternum, creatorem
rerum omnium, cum visibilium tum invisibilium, summum bonum. vivum, et omnia
vivificantem et conservantem, omnipotentem et summe sapientem, clementem sive mi-
sericordem, iustum atque veracem.” E. F. Karl Müller, Die Bekenntnisschriften der
reformierten Kirche, Leipzig 1903, 173.

Aurelio A. Garcı´a

dai, the concept summum bonum becomes explicit: the self-desi-
gnation Shaddai, with which God represents himself in the context
of his covenanting with Abraham, not only means his self-suffici-
ency in the sense of his self-reliance and independence, but also the
quality flowing out of Him as being the highest good and the
source of all goodness.26 The soteriological implications of God’s
self-disclosure through the names become clear. To paraphrase
Opitz, Bullinger sees the name “Yahweh” as connected to his na-
ture as life-creating and life-sustaining; the name “El” as relating
to God’s helping presence; the name “Shaddai” as pertaining to
the divine covenanting commitment, and to his acknowledgement
of his being the highest good, and of his role as the one who can
and will provide salvation.27 Bullinger then goes on to produce an
etymology of the German word Gott as meaning “bonum sive
optimum maximum, das höchste, oberist gut.”28

In Compendium christianae religionis decem libris comprehen-
sum, God is the Highest Good particularly for humanity: God is
the creator and governor of all created things, and the highest good
of humans. Thus the stress is laid not so much in his ontological
status as in the relationship to humanity.29

In The Old Faith he also uses the term briefly to describe God,
among other attributes. However, a particular aspect of Bullin-
ger’s understanding of the function of the term is immediately ap-
parent. The importance is that the covenant, I will be your God, is
the place Bullinger understands summum bonum should appear.
Summum bonum, God’s very nature, is the divine compliance in
the covenant: I shall be your God, you shall be my people. God
Himself is the basis of faith, thus the expression is related to the

commandment: you shall have no other gods. This is a salvation-
historical context:

“Now wholly on the contrary fairness itself required that this man, who
had been endowed by God with a subtle reason, and singular sharpness of
intellect and goodness of will and exceptional strength, would show himself
grateful towards Him who had amply bestowed him with gifts, and be
most dutiful in everything to his benefactor Creator. Indeed God who not
only was good but also just, ordered the human being (having enacted a
fair ordinance) truly to enjoy fully all the delightful fruits of the garden, as
long as he abstained from the fruits of the knowledge of good and evil. This
precept in itself was neither burdensome nor unfair, for it did not postulate
anything but loving obedience and reverence to the Divine spirit: unto
whom alone man should look with the eyes of the soul and to him hold fast
with whole faith and trust as highest good and as most benign towards
men, and not make up on his own the forms of good and evil, but rather to
take as unlawful what God forbids, and from all to take as good and just
that which God not only approves, but permits and commands (which is
much safer).”30

This salvation-historical approach is reinforced later in the text,
when summum bonum is turned into summus thesaurus:31

“Abel lived humbly, was upright and trusted God firmly. He always held
God as his highest treasure, and offered him the best and foremost gifts he
had, doubtless holding the opinion in his mind that this very God was
creator of all souls with bodies and of all faculties, and was beyond com-

30 “Iam e converso omnino aequitas ipsa expostulabat, ut ille homo, qui subtili
ratione, et singulari intellectus acrimonia voluntatisque bonitate et viribus praestantibus
a deo praeditus erat, erga eundem, qui amplissima haec in eum effunderat dona,gratum
se exhiberet, atque benefactori creatori et domino per omnia esset obsequentissimus.
Imo deus qui non modo bonus sed et iustus est, tale quiddam (promulgata lege aequa)
ab homine postulabat, nimirum ut omnibus amoenissimi huius horti fructibus ad vo-
luptatem usque frueretur, tantum a fructu scientiae boni ac mali abstineret. Id praecep-
tum per se neque graue neque iniquum erat, siquidem nihil aliud postulabat, quam
obedientiam cum dilectione et reverentia divini numinis: in quod homo dei creatura
oculus animi unice intendere, in hoc ut summum bonum et erga hominines benignissi-
mum, omnem spem et fiduciam figere, non autem ex semetipso sapere formasque boni

permisit sed et praecepit.” Heinrich Bullinger, Antiquissima fides et vera religio, Zurich
1544, 4v.

adults: they should see God as “Omnium bonorum thesaurum.” Heinrich Bullinger,

mitting any hypocrisy or deceit; and also sought every good in Him as most
beneficent.”32

Noah had saving faith, which took hold on Christ the promise,
believing that God is the source of all good:

“Believing these words firmly, Noah served God through Christ. He show-
ed openly and clearly these particular signs of faith, before the deluge,
which covered everything after the rains, once they had gone down, as soon
as he had left the arch, he hastened to offer sacrifice; as if he were offering
testimony by most certain marks and arguments from the heart of his gra-
titude and fastness of faith: at the same time confessing God to be the
author of all goodness, who had promised to him and his posterity the
blessed seed, which is to say, he had promised his own Son, so that he may
reconcile the human race to divine justice by the sacrifice of his own bo-
dy.”33

In the previous text summum bonum has become deum omnium
bonorum esse authorem, which is pretty much the previous theo-
logical definition.

In the book, Antithesis et compendium evangelicae et papisticae
doctrinae Bullinger utilizes the concept summum bonum as the
basis for the rejection of the cult and invocation of saints: “God is
the only, eternal, and highest good, who wishes alone to be
adored, worshipped and invoked. In Him alone and in no other
whatsoever the absolute good is to be found. Only in His Name
should it be sworn.”34

32 In the latin version of The Old Faith: “cumque deum pro summo suo thesauro

haberet [...]” Bullinger, Antiquissima fides, 15v.

33 “His verbis firmiter credens Noe, a deo per Christum servatus est. Hic ut certis
quibusdam signis fidem suam apertius atque evidentius ostenderet, quamprimum aquae
diluii, quae ex imbribus auctae omnia contexterant, iam subsedissent, protinus relicta
arca, ad sacrificia offerenda properavit: quibus veluti certissimis indiciis et argumentis
animi sui et gratitudinem, et constantiam fidei testarentur: simul etiam confiteretur
deum omnium bonorum esse authorem, qui sibi, suisque posteris semen benedictum, id
est filium suum promiserit, qui corporis sui perlitatione humanum genus diuinae iusti-
tiae reconciliet.” Bullinger, Antiquissima fides, 19v.

invocari. In solo enim neque in alio quoquam invenitur absolutiss. bonum. Per ipsius
solius nomen iurandum est.” Heinrich Bullinger, Antithesis et compendium evangelicae
et papisticae doctrinae, Zurich 1551, 4.

“Summum Bonum” in the Zurich Reformation

In his Catechism for adults Bullinger asks: “In which way or
when do we sanctify the name of the Lord? The answer is, when
we feel and speak about God and things of religion in a pious and
saintly way, giving honor: when we place nothing before God and
divine things, but rather we hold as most important and principal
his established laws about doctrine and rites, and acknowledge the
Lord himself as highest good: from whom alone we depend, in
whom only in all things we regard, whom we invoke and praise
and glorify [...].”35 So too in the same work when dealing with the
covenant he specifies the way God fulfills his part in it: “Explain to
me then how God wishes to make himself available to human
beings? Answer: He desires to be our God, not in a common or
universal way, but in a particular and singular way: that is, He
wishes to be our wholeness and total sufficiency in whom then we
may have all good things most handily and abundantly, both of the
soul and of the body, both present and future [...]”36

In this context, God as summum bonum is not merely the su-
preme good in the chain of being, but the supreme good for the
human covenanting partner. Notice the expression “vult esse ple-
nitude et omnisufficientia nostra: in quo videlicet habeamus omnia
[...] praestantissima abundantissimaque bona.” Is this not the tra-
ditional definition of summum bonum? But this passage makes
God’s status as summum bonum much more specific: he is the
source of all good for those in the covenant of grace! Can we not
read in this expression “non modo communis [...] sed veluti pe-
culiaris” as an affirmation of an elective grace, a chosen people? Is
it not a passing from a general to a particular grace? In a sense our
part in the Covenant is, as Watson would say of Luther’s theology
of grace, letting God be God.37

35 Bullinger, Catechesis, 17r–v.
36 “Explica ergo mihi qualem se deus velit paestare hominibus? Vult ille non modo
communis vel universalis, sed veluti peculiaris uniuscuiusque nostrum esse deus: id est,
vult esse plenitudo et omnisufficientia nostrae: in quo videlicet habeamus omnia, cum
anime, tum corporis, et presentis et futurae, praestantissima abundantissima bona [...].”
Bullinger, Catechesis, 7r–v.

a similar, although distinctive accommodation of the platonic concept of God’s good-
ness is found in Calvin. Here the stress is on the terms of participation and accom-
modation, which are so understood as to avoid a mingling or confusion of substances,

Now a further difference becomes apparent: Zwingli has not
neglected the Trinitarian aspect of the divinity. This omnisuffi-
ciency is transferred to Christ, who then becomes our plenitude, as
the work Der Christenheit rechte Volkommenheit clearly shows.
Bullinger cites several New Testament texts with a Platonist tinge,
in this particular case in order to counter any claims that the
church may raise as a divine-human mediator (contra Trent): “That
God the Father, in his only-begotten Son alone has given us all full
perfection, so that when we hold unto Him in true faith, nor
should we go begging for that perfection elsewhere.”38

Thus the fullness and saving quality of God the Creator is to be
found only in Christ.39 And this testimony is received in the believ-
er’s hearts:

“With this believers receive in their hearts from the Holy Spirit, through the
narrative of the word of truth that all perfection is in Christ; therefore they
are at peace, and are based solely on him. And thus they find no one
anywhere at all to be an equal to the son of God, in wisdom, power,
righteousness, graciousness, good-willing, or which so eager and ready,
who is so adroit and fast with things. He has all our concerns before his
eyes. As soon as he receives the prayer of the believer he attends to it the
very moment. Therefore all believers rush solely to the only Lord Christ.”40

The previous text reveals that summum bonum as title or charac-
teristic of God relates to Christology. This is borne out by the
following quote from Fundamentum Firmum, where the relations-
hip is made even more explicit:

and ensuring a preservation of the distinction between creator and creature. See Paul

Grundzug in der Theologie Calvins?, in: Zwingliana 19/2 (1993), 59–72.

“Summum Bonum” in the Zurich Reformation

“So that no doubt may remain in any, I consequently bring forth the wit-
ness of Holy Scripture, that the church in the Lord Christ has all pleni-
tude/fullness, and by faith in Him thus is perfected or absolved, that all life
and salvation should be expected, not elsewhere but alone from Christ. For
the Lord in Isaiah calls all unto Him, and promises to them the whole
fullness of all good things, and says, O you who thirst, Come to the waters,
and you who have no money, come, buy and eat.”41

Here Bullinger states clearly that the church has all plenitude in
Christ, and by faith is perfected and granted life only inasmuch as
it trusts solely in Him. And the Lord in Isaiah, calling all unto
Himself, promises to all the whole fullness [saturitas] of all good
[bonorum omnium]. Thus closeness, even equivalency is traced
between God the Father and the Son Jesus Christ. Bullinger shows
thus that when he speaks of God as summum bonum he ultimately
has in mind the whole Trinity.

Such passages which speak of perfection or plenitude obviously
depend conceptually on the letters to the Ephesians and to the
Colossians (Eph. 1:23; 3:19; 4:13; Col. 1:19; 2:9). In Ephesians
1:23 the Greek has ηÏτις εÆ στιÁν τοÁ σωÄ μα αυ Æ τουÄ, τοÁ πληÂ ρωμα του Ä ταÁ
παÂ ντα εÆ ν παÄ σιν πληρουμε Âνου; this is rendered in the Vulgate:
“quae est corpus ipsius plenitudo eius qui omnia in omnibus adim-
pletur.” In his Commentary on the Pauline epistles, Bullinger un-
derstands these passages in a fully soteriological sense, relating
them not primarily to the ontology of God or of creation, but to an
eschatological fulfillment which occurs in Christ’s life and death.
(We must remember in Bullinger the divine essence as summum
bonum becomes manifest as mercy and overflowing love, which is
the divine condition in the covenant. The covenant is God being
Himself towards us, His being overflowing goodness). Bullinger
here stresses the glorification and resurrection doctrines, and how

41 “Sed ne quid dubitationis apud ullos resideat, commonstrabo consequenter scrip-
turae sanctae testimoniis, Ecclesiam Christi in Christo domino omnem habere plenitu-
dinem, ac per fidem in ipsum ita perfici vel absolui, ut omnia vitae et salutis non
aliunde, nisi ex solo Christo expectet. Etenim Dominus apud Isaiam omnes ad se vocat,
omnibusque plenam bonorum omnium saturitatem promittit, ac dicit, O vos omnes qui
sititis, Venite ad aquas, et hi quibus non est pecunia, venite, emite et comedite. Parate
cibum sine argento, et sine precio vinum et lac.” Heinrich Bullinger, Fundamentum
firmum, cui tuto fidelis quivis inniti potest, hoc praesertim difficili seculo, quo dissidiis
doctorumque adversariis scriptis omnia conturbata sunt, Zurich 1563, 16v.

believers participate in these benefits through union with Christ.
“Therefore Paul in this place understands by these words and
things the diverse collection of excellent things in the world, not
only the worldly, but also the celestial; that is, the domain of all
things visible and invisible. [...] For then those who trust in Christ
are the participants in all heavenly goods, given that we be mem-
bers of the body of Christ, and he our head.”42 Bullinger refutes
the error of those who may think this means that evil deeds are
fulfilled or perfected in us by Christ. Rather, this means that he
teaches rather that Christ is τοÁ πληÂ ρωμα , that is, the plenitude of
believers and their supplement;43 who by his infirmities fills and
absolves those who are destitute and flatly empty of divine things.
At the end he states that God in Jesus Christ has poured himself
totally and opened up for us all the treasures of knowledge and
salvation.44

In Colossians 2:9 the text reads, οÏτι εÆ ν αυÆ τ ìωÄ κατοικειÄ παÄ ν τοÁ
πληÂ ρωμα τηÄς θεοÂ τητος σωματικωÄ ς; in the Vulgate: quia in ipso
inhabitat omnis plenitudo divinitatis corporaliter. The word
πληÂ ρωμα will become the standard neo-platonic term for the One
which out of essential superabundance overflows thus creating the
world, and which is the fount of all good, the summum bonum.45
In the discussion of this passage Bullinger is even more reformato-
ry and soteriological. He states it means that nothing beyond
Christ is necessary for us. Having Christ, the church has all things;
whoever has been grafted into him by faith, likewise is wholly
perfected and justified. All things relevant to life and salvation are
to be sought only in Christ. After discussing the meaning of cor-
poraliter to mean not bodily, but naturally, Bullinger surprises us
by implying a parallel between redemption and creation, saying
that Christ is, properly and at the same time with the Father, the
principle of all created things.46 In essence, then, he transfers the

43 Supplementum is ample in scope; here it probably means he completes them and

supplies their needs.

“Summum Bonum” in the Zurich Reformation

content of the epithet summum bonum from an unqualified “God”
to Christ.

To conclude, we can state that in Bullinger summum bonum is a
term to be associated with the divine name, and which he has
received from the tradition. But for the most part it is not an
irreplaceable description, for other terms can take its place. The
term summum bonum stands above all for the one-sidedness of the
covenant, the sovereign grace of God. It is at times explicitly con-
nected with salvation in Christ, as a way of introducing the divine
side of the covenant, God as source of all grace. Thus too, when
approaching New Testament elements of Christology having a Pla-
tonic conceptual afinity, the term functions to hold in close rela-
tion the creative and the redemptive power of Christ. While Bul-
linger is faithful to the general concept and to the relationship of
the term to the divine name Zwingli already used, the general ten-
dency is to leave further behind the ontological and to emphasize
more strongly the covenantal and soteriological aspect. What in
Zwingli is a tendency to direct the ontological import of the term
summum bonum in a soteriological direction, in Bullinger becomes
a quite consistent basis for the development of covenant theology.

Abstract: Huldrych Zwingli has been rashly criticized for his philosophical theology,
manifest in works such as “De Providentia Dei”, by those whose measure of what
constituted the true Reformation was a strict Biblicism, and who viewed philosophical
theology as a corrupt remnant from medieval scholasticism. Yet Zwingli deftly uses the
concept with its doctrinal baggage in order to support a doctrine of God’s Providence
and grace towards humanity. Ultimately the Reformer derives providence and predes-
tination, indeed the whole salvific economy, from a philosophical concept of God as
supreme power and as highest good. In his own time Zwingli’s successor, Heinrich
Bullinger, had to defend Zwingli’s openness to classical philosophy and his acceptance
of the pagan quest for truth. This concept of “Summum bonum” also occurs in Bullin-
ger at key points, being not only understood as all-sufficiency but also related to the

aliis rebus ad perfectionem, quod adveresarii nostril tradunt, reuera enim omnis rerum
divinarum plenitudo et perfectio in Christo vere et naturaliter est non usurpative aut
alieno more, esd omnino proprio cum simul cum patre sit principium rerum omnium
creaturarum dominus potentissimorum spirituum angelorum et quicquid hic mundus
magnificum potens et excellens habet.” Bullinger, In omnes Apostolicas epistolas, 485.

names of God and thus to the Divine self-revelation, indeed as a source of covenant
history. This paper explores the roots of this concept and how it evolves into a salva-
tion-historical and therefore biblical motif in the Zurich Reformation and thus its im-
port for the understanding of God’s relation to the created order.
